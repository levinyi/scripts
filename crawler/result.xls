b"So far, this purchase has been my single greatest move as the husband of a pregnant wife. There are a few particular features that I'd love to discuss:-Jersey cover: my wife LOVES this material. It holds up well, and it seems to only get more comfortable throughout its lifetime. The cover is very easy to pull off and wash. It's slightly more difficult to put back on the pillow -- I'd suggest that it's a two-person job.-Shape: The support this shape gives is seemingly unrivaled. I had purchased a couple of other support-style pillows before this one, but where this one really shines above the others is this: you don't have to maneuver to keep it in place. It's just there. You can elevate your feet, or you can tuck it in between your legs. You can rest on your back, or you can flip to your side (and still have belly support). It's an extremely versatile shape.-Zipper: Minor detail here, but the zipper placement is great. It allows you to flip the pillow without it interfering with your sleep at all.I would highly recommend this product."
b'This pillow has been one of the best purchases of my life.I never sleep without it now. I find my fiance using it all the time. In his words, it is "the best sleeping product ever invented". My animals love it, too. It get some of the best sleep I have ever gotten. Pregnant or not, I think everyone should own this pillow. My only complaint is that it makes getting out of bed to pee three times a night difficult, because I am too comfy to want to get up... but the second I lie back down after emptying my bladder, I am back to peak comfort.I can sleep with it, sit up with it supporting my swollen feet, use it to give my back extra support while reading. It does it all!I can not speak highly enough of this pillow. I WILL WARN, it\'s a bit of a pain in the butt to get into the pillow case at first, just due to the weird shape of the pillow, but it\'s really not a big deal.I can NOT speak higher of this pillow, and I implore everyone to buy one. FORGET body pillows. PREGNANCY PILLOWS WILL RULE THE PILLOW WORLD.'
b'Oh. My. Word. I swear this thing is heaven sent!  I\xe2\x80\x99m actually irritated that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy one when I was pregnant two years ago.  Not only have my nightly leg and foot cramps all but disappeared (I still have them on occasion but not nearly as often nor as intense), but I sleep almost every night like I haven\xe2\x80\x99t in years.  With this pillow I fall asleep and, unless needing a bathroom break, I am OUT.  I often wake up with a sore/stiff shoulder simply because I sleep so well that I don\xe2\x80\x99t budge.I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will stop using this even after I have the baby.Before anyone assumes: I was not given this product in exchange for a review or other compensation.  I just wanted to try it because I was desperate, it had good reviews, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t outrageously expensive. :)'
b"Seriously love this pillow. It it's like a hug and a snuggle without the body heat. It supports all the right places. My husband HATES this pillow with a passion I cannot explain. I keep trying to get him to give it a shot but he hates competing with it for space. I wish I could care that he hates it, but it's the only thing that helps me sleep."
b"Great buy! I am glad I decide to go for it.  I was hesitant because it isn't cheap and people said it is huge, but I am very happy.  I am not small and we have a full bed and this has been fine.  It has really helped me sleep! I am 23 weeks pregnant and the past couple weeks have been more difficult for sleeping.  This pillow has helped me to sleep comfortably on my left side and stay tilted when I'm on my back with my legs up.  I love it! Only complaint would be that it is warm, but nothing other than that.  It is soft and comfy, not too firm.  Love it!"
b'Love it! My husband and I have changed our time measurement to BP (Before Pillow) and AP (After Pillow). I wasn\'t sleeping well BP and would wake up 5-7 times a night, getting out of bed around 4 times for whatever reason. I would toss and turn and talk in my sleep and sometimes kick my poor husband. AP, I still wake up a few times per night (those raging hormones!) but I fall right back to sleep and feel rested in the morning. Aside from that, I don\'t thrash about anymore. I\'m a right-side sleeper, but am training myself to sleep on my left. This pillow makes it so comfy! You can face either direction, and even on your back, the pillow provides just enough tilt so that you\'re not flat on your back (a pregnancy no-no). The gray matches our sheets so it doesn\'t look too ridiculous. I\'m 5\'1" and it works perfectly for me!'
b'I put off getting a pregnancy pillow because I figured shoving some small pillows behind me and under my knees was good enough.  I really wasn\'t sleeping well and I got a gift card to amazon so I decided to purchase this pillow at about 5 months pregnant.  I have significant neck issues where I use an orthopedic pillow and I was worried this may not work for me but it\'s been great!  The first time I curled up in it, I thought- "Where have you been all my life, my good friend?"  It did take about a week for my body to contour the neck area just right and for me to learn how to flip over in the middle of the night in a smooth motion but it has been really wonderful and has helped me sleep much better.  It\'s way easier than having to wake up more to find the pillow that become dislodged and get it sleepily back into place.  A little expensive but definitely worth it.'
b"I absolutely LOVE my c-pillow!!! I got it around week 20 of my pregnancy, and now at 27 weeks, I don't know how I could've gotten by without it. It helps me be so much more comfortable when I'm sleeping than placing a bunch of pillows around my body, and I've even traveled with it. Washing/putting back on the pillowcase was very easy too (it was weird figuring out where to zip it up the first time but now, after seeing it once, it's a snap). It helps me sit up and read when I need to, and works well with other pillows (for when I need to elevate myself for heartburn). It is a little large for a queen-sized bed, but there is still plenty of space and sometimes I wake up and see my hubby's face sleeping on part of the pillow too because it's so comfy (even though he jokingly complains that I'm pushing him out of the bed). Fin: I LOVE THIS PILLOW."
b"A great buy! Very comfy. My favorite part is how it goes between your knees, although now that I'm a little bigger it's harder to switch sides because you have to take your leg out from under, flip over, and put your other leg under. But that comes with the big-belly territory, I guess. I purchased this a couple months ago---I'm currently 6.5months pregnant, and now that my belly is bigger, I like to lean on the long side of the pillow, and it's almost like you're sleeping on your belly (my preferred sleeping position, pre-pregnancy). I have noticed, however, that I have been waking up on my back quite a big with both legs over the end of the pillow--not sure if that has anything to do with the pillow shape or if I just end up stuck that way in my sleep lol."
b"Currently 16 weeks pregnant with twins and I have been using this pillow since around 12 weeks when my belly started popping up.  I'm usually a stomach sleeper so I believe this pillow is the only reason I've gotten any sleep since then.  It was much fluffier than I expected.  I thought I would still want to use a pillow for my head with this, but I have had no problems using this as both my head and body pillow.  We'll see if I still like it when I am the size of a whale, but so far I love it!"

b'This pillow is a pregnancy game-changer. I had been suffering from severe SI pain and sciatica (no amount of stretching was helping). After one night, my pain had lessened and after 3 nights my pain is almost gone. It takes a while to get used to sleeping with it but it\xe2\x80\x99s soooo worth it. I do find if I sleep towards the opening of the C, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough support for my large belly. That being said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to use this than the 4-5 other pillows I had that weren\xe2\x80\x99t working. My husband also prefers this in our bed over the pillow fort I had before. I have always had bad neck problems and used a memory foam therapeutic pillow for years, but I find this does the job well and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up with neck or shoulder pain. Best purchase ever, I wish I had bought it sooner!!!'
b'I was skeptical of buying a pillow for this price specifically because of pregnancy but after almost 2 weeks not being able to sleep well and being in pain at night due to hip pain, back pain, and sciatic nerve pain due to being pregnant, I finally gave in and bought this pillow. Every pregnant woman out there please listen to me: if you love yourself buy this pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s been exactly 24 hours and my life is changed. Also if you have a toddler who likes to sleep with you still don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that. My 18 month old fits perfectly with me with the huge pillow perfectly and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the comfort at all. Only negative thing I have to say is it\xe2\x80\x99s a magnet to husbands. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get him one too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 24 weeks and just starting to feel uncomfortable (lower back pain, random aches, etc) so I decided to do a little research and I selected this pillow based on reviews and recommendations. Best decision ever! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never slept better! Also, when I\xe2\x80\x99m just lounging, watching TV or reading, I fold the pillow in half and use it as back support. My husband calls it my \xe2\x80\x9cpillow fortress\xe2\x80\x9d so I made him try it today... We are now ordering another one for him! He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how comfortable it was! I highly recommend this product, even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not pregnant. (Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of a germaphobe, so I love that it comes with a washable, super soft jersey knit cover!)'
b"Let me start off by saying I'm not pregnant, nor have I ever been, nor do I ever intend to be. I do, however, have two herniated discs in my low back and am addicted to comfort. Well, this has been the best and worst thing I've ever purchased.The best because it is magical. I like to prop one end up on some pillows then lie on my back inside of it like a nest with the other end supporting my knees. It makes reading easier because my arms are propped up on the sides and it makes sleeping into a heavenly experience. I'm naturally a stomach sleeper so I eventually flip over and stretch out the C in my sleep to more of an L while I spoon the top half between my head and arm (perfect height for stomach sleepers) and have moved the bottom half out of the way of my feet.The worst because I am quite literally incapable of sleeping without it now. It makes the quality of my sleep so much better sleeping without it is pure torture now. Most recently it made sleeping on a rock hard, 15+ year-old, super lumpy futon a pleasant experience..."
b"It's not the biggest or best pillow out there, but it's been a lifesaver and you can't beat the price. If you have excess cash, buy a more premium one, but if you are budget couscous like me, this is well worth the money. Don't think I could sleep at all without it-- pregnancy is harder than I expected!"
b"I'm expecting multiples after 2 other children and finally caved and bought one of these pregnancy pillows. I should have bought one years ago!!!! I always sleep on my stomach and have a terrible time sleeping any other way. I am now a side sleeper as this pillow makes a cozy little nest and keeps me from turning. I never wake up with an aching neck or shoulders. It's glorious. Buy one now. It does take up about half of my queen bed but my husband hasn't complained."
b'Photo is the pillow on a twin mattress. It perhaps may look a little weird in the photo but you can manipulate the shape to your liking.I should first say that I am not pregnant but the hilarious pregnant reviewers who swore by this thing for all of mankind persuaded me that I needed it and they were RIGHT. this thing is amazing. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a rosebud. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a big hug but not in a claustrophobic-awful way, but like you\xe2\x80\x99re just supported all over. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. You can manipulate it to get more or less support in various places or change the places on your body you want support and still put a pillow underneath the head part to keep high elevation if you need it. Also the whole outside zips off like a pillowcase which you can wash. Also I want to marry this. You need this.'
b'I got this pillow after one of my friends told me it was a lifersaver during her pregnancy. It helps a lot, specially if you are a back sleeper and have to switch to being a side sleeper. I was able to angle myself so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on my back, but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely on my side. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to being on my side and the pillow helps me to stay that way.  It\xe2\x80\x99s great to have it between your knees when you are on your side. The pillow is soft and comfortable. Often times, I find my husbands knees on the pillow also!! He agrees it\xe2\x80\x99s very comfortable. The pillowcase is very soft.  I would recommend this pillow.'

b"My husband is well aware of the fact that this pillow has now replaced him. I made it to my third trimester not needing a support pillow, then one day my spawn kept flipping me like a pancake onto my back. Deciding that a battle of wills with an unborn hellion was going to result in me losing every single time, I dragged this down from the guest room and now I'm in love and leaving my husband to start my new life with my pregnancy pillow. It will just be the two of us (and I guess the baby? Maybe?) relaxing on the beach, sleeping soundly, wrapped around each other like little monkeys, with not a care in the world and not an ache in our spines.This pillow is literally what gets me through the day. Whether I'm sleeping curled up with it, or whether I'm at work dreaming of when I get home and can curl up in it's sweet, supportive embrace, this pillow gets me through some crazy days. I almost weep for joy when I go into my room and see it laying there, waiting to swallow me up in its....arms? Let's go with arms. Otherwise I'm sleeping with my head in a pillows crotch (although that wouldn't taint my love for it one bit).Oh, and the fact that I can pull out stuffing or shove it back in means that not even the irrational whims of a cranky, salty, mercurial pregnant woman can defeat this pillow. Too fluffy? RIP OUT SOME STUFFING AND PRETEND IT'S THAT WOMAN WHO SAID IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING TWINS WHEN YOU SO ARE NOT!! Not enough support? SHOVE SOME STUFFING BACK IN AND PRACTICE THREATENING YOUR OFFSPRING THAT YOU CAN SEND THEM BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM!!I had originally promised to pass this pillow on to a friend after my pregnancy but now I think I'm going to enter the Witness Protection Program with it because I'm sure as hell not giving it up."
b"After reading the other reviews I really didn't understand how any negativity could come from this pillow. No bed bugs, no it wasn't flat (by far the most fluffiest yet firm pillow ever!) and it has been nothing but a blessing! Im 28 weeks pregnant and my hips, ribs and back are constantly in pain.. but after a few nights sleep with my new pillow I get a full 9-10 hours of sleep (not counting the times to go potty), and I could also sit on my couch pain free with it too! My husband wants me to get him one too after taking a nap with it. I didn't even sleep this well when I wasnt pregnant! I'm also 5'8 and the height is a perfect fit for my body! Very, very happy customer and more than satisfied!"
b'I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 88 year old Mother who has severe arthritis.  She has used it every night since Dec. 25 & she said she loves it.  It gives her good neck & head support plus her back.  Since she is a widow & sleeps alone, she tends to get cold.  But this pillow cradles her & keeps her warm also.  She loves it!  She wondered why I was giving her a "pregnancy" pillow!!!  LOL!  She had a good laugh but I explained how I had read that it might help her.  She agrees now!  I highly recommend this for other reasons besides "pregnancy"!  Thank you!'
b'I bought this pillow on 2017 Black Friday weekend, exactly one day after the SALE was over (talk about bad timing?). I was 24 weeks pregnant and I was already uncomfortable every night, although my bump was not so big. I did a lot of pregnancy pillow research before I bought this item and after I read the bad reviews for this product, I was inclined not to purchase it anymore. However, my hubby convinced me to try it and I did it!  I purchased the product on Saturday, regular shipping and I was pleasantly surprised to find it delivered on Monday afternoon. Package looked perfect, easy to open, pillow was brand new, super clean, although I rarely do that with I new purchase, I started using it right away, without even washing the cover. The instructions were simple and clear and I was notified that I have to wait for a while before the pillow goes to its original shape (as it was vacuum sealed). My sleep quality increased tremendously, I would recommend this item to all pregnant women that have trouble sleeping. We own a king size bed and it takes just 50% of it, yes it is bulky and firm, but this is what I was looking for. I am 5\'8-1/2" and fairly "skinny" for a pregnant lady , but I have no complaint about the length and I can tell you my baby is not letting me sleep with my knees as high as the picture shows, he always kicks me and dictates the angle of my thighs. The pillow didn\'t lose its shape 2 months later and I am actually rotating sides each week and I wash the cover every month. The first time we tried to put the cover back it worked like a charm (but I really needed my husband\'s help). The second time I washed it, we were tired and lost our technique so we kind of hassled but not the pillow\'s fault that we weren\'t thinking right at 11 pm. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and I am recommending this pillow to everyone. This is the first time I used a pregnancy pillow and I am not paid for this review.'
b'I\'m not sure why this got some bad reviews. I did a LOT of searching for a pregnancy pillow, and they all come with very mixed reviews. Ultimately after a personal recommendation, I decided on this one. I was worried since the negative reviews specified that it seemed very small and not long enough. I\'m definitely not a small person (plus-sized gal) and I\'m 5\'6", and this works great for me. I am about 4.5 months pregnant and I was starting to get backaches from sleeping, plus I\'m a back sleeper and I kept finding myself on my back through the night.Sleeping with this pillow is like sleeping in a cloud. I thought I\'d hate the filling but it\'s very soft, and not at all lumpy. I don\'t find the neck too high, in fact I put another pillow between my head and this one (granted it\'s a very flat squishy down one). As mentioned, I\'m 5\'6", and while this doesn\'t go all the way to my feet like in the picture, it does hit a little below my knees which is plenty to just keep my hips aligned and to stuff the end of this between my knees.  For those who do want a much bigger one, there does exist a bigger pillow by this same Queen Rose brand, which I\'d have gotten if I didn\'t have a queen-sized bed.  Unfortunately my husband still needs a space :-) This one fits great and he still has plenty of room to sleep.Also, this isn\'t only for pregnant women - my husband loves sleeping in this when I\'m not around, and he said lying in it makes him fall asleep immediately. I only wish I had selected a different color; I only noticed I could get white or gray after I already ordered with the default pink and blue. It\'s a little gaudy. But the cover isn\'t a bad texture at all as some others said - I find it very comfy as is, right out of the package.Oh and it was really fun to open the vacuum-sealed package and watch it spring up into a big fluffy pillow. When it first arrives it definitely looks wilted and flat :)  All in all, great pillow, and totally saving my sleep while pregnant!'
b'I am obsessed! Soon as it came out of the package that kept it flat, it poofed right up. And the grey cover is so soft. You can fluff it up for more support and it\xe2\x80\x99s very versatile. Takes up half the bed so hubby is still fine, maybe just a little jealous lol. He just ends up cuddling the side I\xe2\x80\x99m not using! Recommend this to anyone!'
b"I bought this and the mama bee belly butter combo for my first time expecting wife as a surprise and she lovessss both of them!! She especially loves the body pillow. She says it's so comfortable and helps with knee, back, and neck pain, as well helps her sleep better at night. Definitely recommend for expecting moms and if you're the soon to be dad reading this BUY IT FOR HER SHE'LL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE!!"
b'***updating my review because the seller was fantastic** This pillow wasn\'t for me probably because of my prior spinal and hip problems. The seller offered me the larger version but I just don\'t have space in my bed for it. But they did everything to try to make me happy and ultimately I\'m glad I tried this out. Thanks Queen Rose! I\'d say if you\'re 5\'6" or over get the larger version.I spent forever searching reviews of pregnancy pillows before picking one because I already had back and hip problems prior to pregnancy. This one seemed like a great option in theory but after about a month of use I\'m convinced I don\'t particularly like it. The padding in the pillow is kind of uneven throughout and its incredibly difficult to change positions in it. I wish it was a little longer because I always feel like I\'m tugging it to try to support my legs, and my hip pain has gotten worse if anything since using it, and now I often wake with rib and shoulder pain from the weird position I end up in.  It\'s not a bad pillow. It\'s well constructed, maybe I\'m just not a fan of the u shape style, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for ladies with spinal and hip issues.'
b"This pillow is incredible. I am in my 5th month of pregnancy and even though my tummy isn't huge yet I was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I would toss and turn. My back and hips would hurt throughout the day, I would wake up with headaches, and always be exhausted (and cranky)! This pillow has changed all of that! No joke the first night I slept with this thing I got better sleep than I had in two months. I woke up feeling rested and ready for the day. My back and hips no longer hurt. I didn't wake up nearly as much at night and frankly I am just in a better mood overall because I finally got some sleep! I put off buying this pillow and now I wish I would have had it all the time!"
b"Literally opened it, and my wife is instantly K.O.ed on this pillow.  She's a stomach sleeper, and was having a difficult time getting comfortable in the bed.  This pillow is a life saver - I also like the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell like other pillows.  It's definitely sleep ready right out of the box.  So far it's a winner in my book!"
b'I am over 50 so I am, obviously, not pregnant.  I bought this since I have a hard time getting comfortable and always use 5 or 6 pillows to try to sleep.  This product is so comfortable, that I can finally get some good sleep.  I bought one for my daughter too and she loves it too. It is not just for pregnant people. I also use it to watch TV in bed by crisscrossing the lower parts Good quality.'
b'I am a stomach sleeper so being pregnant is a giant sleeping pain for me. I had to adjust to sleeping on my side but I hate having just a pillow between my knees. I kept getting sciatica in my left hip/butt cheek while sleeping and had to figure something out. I researched a lot of pregnancy pillows and decided on this one 1) because it gives me the ability to rollover and be supported on both sides(I toss alot) and 2) the multiple good reviews. Let me tell you this pillow is worth all 5 stars! It is so comfortable and supports me perfectly while sleeping. I\'ve had it a little over a month and sleep so much better now. I love that I can cuddle it and it\'s not too hot or heavy to keep my arms under. I can push the opposite side behind my back for support and lay facing up a bit comfortably. I can tuck the sides under my legs or butt if I need extra support too - it\'s so amazing! Even my husband loves the pillow and tried to steal it from me after he had ACL surgery and was stuck on the couch. I am definitely going to be using this long after giving birth. Also,  I am 5\'8" and it\'s just about the max length for me to use properly with my legs. It might be a bit less comfy for a taller woman but then again everyone\'s body shape and sleeping positions vary. Don\'t let that discourage you I would still give it a try! I\'m probably going to buy one for my husband and daughter as well because they both love it as much as me lol.'
b"I'm not pregnant.  I'm 68 and I have 6 herniated discs, kyphosis, scoliosis -- serious curves in my spine.  I don't have a medicare doctor with much enthusiasm for helping.  They say use tylenol and heat or ice depending on the talking head so I decided to try a body pillow.  Hard to discern between all the choices, but I picked this one due to reviews and price.  It is nothing short of a miracle.  I am able to sleep lying down on the bed because I don't ever have to let my spine be flat on the bed, I can prop myself up for support.  I can change sides with ease, even sleep partly on my back.  The first night, I slept 10 hours and never moved my position once.  I am so grateful for this relief.  And sleep makes a world of difference healing from this latest bout with a thoracic disk i.e. huge difficulty breathing.  I will never be without it again.  Thanks Queen Rose."
b"Back and neck pain has been 75% better with this. I am 37, 5'11', with arthritis and some deteriorating discs, brand new high end mattress wasn't completely cutting it, this has helped so much!"
b"This pillow is by far the most amazing pillow I have ever used. Of all the products I have bought during my pregnancy to make myself more comfortable, this one takes the cake! I suffer from hormone related insomnia so sleeping has pretty much always been an issue for me, but with this pillow, I am so relaxed and comfortable that I've have been sleeping almost normally. I had a C-shaped body pillow before I found this one and only used it once because of how much I toss and turn at night. With the U-shaped pillow, I can turn over and don't have to worry about trying to flip the pillow with me. I honestly look forward to coming home and laying down now which has never been the case. I would recommend this pillow to anyone and everyone!"
b'I use this pillow for reading at bed before falling asleep. I place the large section behind my head and then place the two \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d next to me or sometimes across my middle to hold the book in place. When I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to sleep, I actually turn the pillow upside down so that my head is on my own pillow while the \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d snuggle against my back and stomach, since I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper. Very comfortable pillow and quite large! We have a Queen sized bed and it takes up my entire half of the bed - with me sandwiched in the middle of the cushions - which is fine with me. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier with it.'
b"I bought this pillow for my pregnant wife after reading tons of reviews on all different types of pillows. She'd been having difficulty sleeping and pain in her back and hips. She started using this pillow and immediately got a better nights sleep. She is 19 weeks pregnant now and has been using it for about 5 weeks. I will say though, we have a queen bed and it takes up more than half the bed. I'm OK with the sacrifice because she sleeps better."
b'This pillow is AMAZING! I had the Leachco Snoogle pillow for my last pregnancy and hated it. The design is terrible and in a \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 shape that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support your belly when the long part is supporting your back. If you flip it and the long part is supporting your belly in the front, then there is a big gap where your back is and you have to put an extra pillow there.Anyway, I was so glad to find something else out there that actually worked and was comfy. The part where you lay your head is also not too fluffy/full (like the Leachco one) and won\xe2\x80\x99t give you a neck ache.I am going to recommend this pillow to all my pregnant friends in the future. :)'
b'I struggle with back pain from a work injury and this pillow helps so much. It can be used with your head on the cross part or by your ankles. I use a temperpedic pillow so I put the top/cross piece between my ankles. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand for my knees or ankles to rub at night. It helps with lower back support and is just plump enough to be comfortable without being too firm or to large to comfortably use without your neck or shoulders sitting at odd angles. My 4 year old stole it to use in her bed because it makes her feel \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d because she won\xe2\x80\x99t roll out of bed. She never has and has rails on her bed but it takes away a fear she has and she likes to snuggle in the i shape. We had to buy another one because she loved it so much too.'
b'I am a stomach sleeper, so pregnancy makes sleeping very difficult for me. I swore after my first pregnancy I would have to do something different as most nights I would end up on the couch after not being able to find a comfortable position. I bought this pillow 10 weeks into my second pregnancy and have slept in my bed every night! (I am now 20 weeks along). I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t like sleeping on my side, but this pillow supports my back and stomach and I like to put it in between my legs. I am able to sleep through the night! It does get a little warm, as the fabric is kind of fuzzy, but it makes such a difference in helping me sleep that it\xe2\x80\x99s not too big a deal to be a little warm. I also had to remove a little of the stuffing as it was too firm for my liking. I would also note that it is very large! I have a king size bed, so my husband still has plenty of room, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much room there would be on a queen. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it, a girl needs her beauty sleep, no? We will have to see how well it helps me sleep as I get bigger, but so far I have no regrets. I would buy this pillow again!'

b"My husband is well aware of the fact that this pillow has now replaced him. I made it to my third trimester not needing a support pillow, then one day my spawn kept flipping me like a pancake onto my back. Deciding that a battle of wills with an unborn hellion was going to result in me losing every single time, I dragged this down from the guest room and now I'm in love and leaving my husband to start my new life with my pregnancy pillow. It will just be the two of us (and I guess the baby? Maybe?) relaxing on the beach, sleeping soundly, wrapped around each other like little monkeys, with not a care in the world and not an ache in our spines.This pillow is literally what gets me through the day. Whether I'm sleeping curled up with it, or whether I'm at work dreaming of when I get home and can curl up in it's sweet, supportive embrace, this pillow gets me through some crazy days. I almost weep for joy when I go into my room and see it laying there, waiting to swallow me up in its....arms? Let's go with arms. Otherwise I'm sleeping with my head in a pillows crotch (although that wouldn't taint my love for it one bit).Oh, and the fact that I can pull out stuffing or shove it back in means that not even the irrational whims of a cranky, salty, mercurial pregnant woman can defeat this pillow. Too fluffy? RIP OUT SOME STUFFING AND PRETEND IT'S THAT WOMAN WHO SAID IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING TWINS WHEN YOU SO ARE NOT!! Not enough support? SHOVE SOME STUFFING BACK IN AND PRACTICE THREATENING YOUR OFFSPRING THAT YOU CAN SEND THEM BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM!!I had originally promised to pass this pillow on to a friend after my pregnancy but now I think I'm going to enter the Witness Protection Program with it because I'm sure as hell not giving it up."
b"After reading the other reviews I really didn't understand how any negativity could come from this pillow. No bed bugs, no it wasn't flat (by far the most fluffiest yet firm pillow ever!) and it has been nothing but a blessing! Im 28 weeks pregnant and my hips, ribs and back are constantly in pain.. but after a few nights sleep with my new pillow I get a full 9-10 hours of sleep (not counting the times to go potty), and I could also sit on my couch pain free with it too! My husband wants me to get him one too after taking a nap with it. I didn't even sleep this well when I wasnt pregnant! I'm also 5'8 and the height is a perfect fit for my body! Very, very happy customer and more than satisfied!"
b'I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 88 year old Mother who has severe arthritis.  She has used it every night since Dec. 25 & she said she loves it.  It gives her good neck & head support plus her back.  Since she is a widow & sleeps alone, she tends to get cold.  But this pillow cradles her & keeps her warm also.  She loves it!  She wondered why I was giving her a "pregnancy" pillow!!!  LOL!  She had a good laugh but I explained how I had read that it might help her.  She agrees now!  I highly recommend this for other reasons besides "pregnancy"!  Thank you!'
b'I bought this pillow on 2017 Black Friday weekend, exactly one day after the SALE was over (talk about bad timing?). I was 24 weeks pregnant and I was already uncomfortable every night, although my bump was not so big. I did a lot of pregnancy pillow research before I bought this item and after I read the bad reviews for this product, I was inclined not to purchase it anymore. However, my hubby convinced me to try it and I did it!  I purchased the product on Saturday, regular shipping and I was pleasantly surprised to find it delivered on Monday afternoon. Package looked perfect, easy to open, pillow was brand new, super clean, although I rarely do that with I new purchase, I started using it right away, without even washing the cover. The instructions were simple and clear and I was notified that I have to wait for a while before the pillow goes to its original shape (as it was vacuum sealed). My sleep quality increased tremendously, I would recommend this item to all pregnant women that have trouble sleeping. We own a king size bed and it takes just 50% of it, yes it is bulky and firm, but this is what I was looking for. I am 5\'8-1/2" and fairly "skinny" for a pregnant lady , but I have no complaint about the length and I can tell you my baby is not letting me sleep with my knees as high as the picture shows, he always kicks me and dictates the angle of my thighs. The pillow didn\'t lose its shape 2 months later and I am actually rotating sides each week and I wash the cover every month. The first time we tried to put the cover back it worked like a charm (but I really needed my husband\'s help). The second time I washed it, we were tired and lost our technique so we kind of hassled but not the pillow\'s fault that we weren\'t thinking right at 11 pm. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and I am recommending this pillow to everyone. This is the first time I used a pregnancy pillow and I am not paid for this review.'
b'I\'m not sure why this got some bad reviews. I did a LOT of searching for a pregnancy pillow, and they all come with very mixed reviews. Ultimately after a personal recommendation, I decided on this one. I was worried since the negative reviews specified that it seemed very small and not long enough. I\'m definitely not a small person (plus-sized gal) and I\'m 5\'6", and this works great for me. I am about 4.5 months pregnant and I was starting to get backaches from sleeping, plus I\'m a back sleeper and I kept finding myself on my back through the night.Sleeping with this pillow is like sleeping in a cloud. I thought I\'d hate the filling but it\'s very soft, and not at all lumpy. I don\'t find the neck too high, in fact I put another pillow between my head and this one (granted it\'s a very flat squishy down one). As mentioned, I\'m 5\'6", and while this doesn\'t go all the way to my feet like in the picture, it does hit a little below my knees which is plenty to just keep my hips aligned and to stuff the end of this between my knees.  For those who do want a much bigger one, there does exist a bigger pillow by this same Queen Rose brand, which I\'d have gotten if I didn\'t have a queen-sized bed.  Unfortunately my husband still needs a space :-) This one fits great and he still has plenty of room to sleep.Also, this isn\'t only for pregnant women - my husband loves sleeping in this when I\'m not around, and he said lying in it makes him fall asleep immediately. I only wish I had selected a different color; I only noticed I could get white or gray after I already ordered with the default pink and blue. It\'s a little gaudy. But the cover isn\'t a bad texture at all as some others said - I find it very comfy as is, right out of the package.Oh and it was really fun to open the vacuum-sealed package and watch it spring up into a big fluffy pillow. When it first arrives it definitely looks wilted and flat :)  All in all, great pillow, and totally saving my sleep while pregnant!'
b'I am obsessed! Soon as it came out of the package that kept it flat, it poofed right up. And the grey cover is so soft. You can fluff it up for more support and it\xe2\x80\x99s very versatile. Takes up half the bed so hubby is still fine, maybe just a little jealous lol. He just ends up cuddling the side I\xe2\x80\x99m not using! Recommend this to anyone!'
b"I bought this and the mama bee belly butter combo for my first time expecting wife as a surprise and she lovessss both of them!! She especially loves the body pillow. She says it's so comfortable and helps with knee, back, and neck pain, as well helps her sleep better at night. Definitely recommend for expecting moms and if you're the soon to be dad reading this BUY IT FOR HER SHE'LL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE!!"
b'***updating my review because the seller was fantastic** This pillow wasn\'t for me probably because of my prior spinal and hip problems. The seller offered me the larger version but I just don\'t have space in my bed for it. But they did everything to try to make me happy and ultimately I\'m glad I tried this out. Thanks Queen Rose! I\'d say if you\'re 5\'6" or over get the larger version.I spent forever searching reviews of pregnancy pillows before picking one because I already had back and hip problems prior to pregnancy. This one seemed like a great option in theory but after about a month of use I\'m convinced I don\'t particularly like it. The padding in the pillow is kind of uneven throughout and its incredibly difficult to change positions in it. I wish it was a little longer because I always feel like I\'m tugging it to try to support my legs, and my hip pain has gotten worse if anything since using it, and now I often wake with rib and shoulder pain from the weird position I end up in.  It\'s not a bad pillow. It\'s well constructed, maybe I\'m just not a fan of the u shape style, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for ladies with spinal and hip issues.'
b"This pillow is incredible. I am in my 5th month of pregnancy and even though my tummy isn't huge yet I was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I would toss and turn. My back and hips would hurt throughout the day, I would wake up with headaches, and always be exhausted (and cranky)! This pillow has changed all of that! No joke the first night I slept with this thing I got better sleep than I had in two months. I woke up feeling rested and ready for the day. My back and hips no longer hurt. I didn't wake up nearly as much at night and frankly I am just in a better mood overall because I finally got some sleep! I put off buying this pillow and now I wish I would have had it all the time!"
b"Literally opened it, and my wife is instantly K.O.ed on this pillow.  She's a stomach sleeper, and was having a difficult time getting comfortable in the bed.  This pillow is a life saver - I also like the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell like other pillows.  It's definitely sleep ready right out of the box.  So far it's a winner in my book!"
b'I am over 50 so I am, obviously, not pregnant.  I bought this since I have a hard time getting comfortable and always use 5 or 6 pillows to try to sleep.  This product is so comfortable, that I can finally get some good sleep.  I bought one for my daughter too and she loves it too. It is not just for pregnant people. I also use it to watch TV in bed by crisscrossing the lower parts Good quality.'
b'I am a stomach sleeper so being pregnant is a giant sleeping pain for me. I had to adjust to sleeping on my side but I hate having just a pillow between my knees. I kept getting sciatica in my left hip/butt cheek while sleeping and had to figure something out. I researched a lot of pregnancy pillows and decided on this one 1) because it gives me the ability to rollover and be supported on both sides(I toss alot) and 2) the multiple good reviews. Let me tell you this pillow is worth all 5 stars! It is so comfortable and supports me perfectly while sleeping. I\'ve had it a little over a month and sleep so much better now. I love that I can cuddle it and it\'s not too hot or heavy to keep my arms under. I can push the opposite side behind my back for support and lay facing up a bit comfortably. I can tuck the sides under my legs or butt if I need extra support too - it\'s so amazing! Even my husband loves the pillow and tried to steal it from me after he had ACL surgery and was stuck on the couch. I am definitely going to be using this long after giving birth. Also,  I am 5\'8" and it\'s just about the max length for me to use properly with my legs. It might be a bit less comfy for a taller woman but then again everyone\'s body shape and sleeping positions vary. Don\'t let that discourage you I would still give it a try! I\'m probably going to buy one for my husband and daughter as well because they both love it as much as me lol.'
b"I'm not pregnant.  I'm 68 and I have 6 herniated discs, kyphosis, scoliosis -- serious curves in my spine.  I don't have a medicare doctor with much enthusiasm for helping.  They say use tylenol and heat or ice depending on the talking head so I decided to try a body pillow.  Hard to discern between all the choices, but I picked this one due to reviews and price.  It is nothing short of a miracle.  I am able to sleep lying down on the bed because I don't ever have to let my spine be flat on the bed, I can prop myself up for support.  I can change sides with ease, even sleep partly on my back.  The first night, I slept 10 hours and never moved my position once.  I am so grateful for this relief.  And sleep makes a world of difference healing from this latest bout with a thoracic disk i.e. huge difficulty breathing.  I will never be without it again.  Thanks Queen Rose."
b"Back and neck pain has been 75% better with this. I am 37, 5'11', with arthritis and some deteriorating discs, brand new high end mattress wasn't completely cutting it, this has helped so much!"
b"This pillow is by far the most amazing pillow I have ever used. Of all the products I have bought during my pregnancy to make myself more comfortable, this one takes the cake! I suffer from hormone related insomnia so sleeping has pretty much always been an issue for me, but with this pillow, I am so relaxed and comfortable that I've have been sleeping almost normally. I had a C-shaped body pillow before I found this one and only used it once because of how much I toss and turn at night. With the U-shaped pillow, I can turn over and don't have to worry about trying to flip the pillow with me. I honestly look forward to coming home and laying down now which has never been the case. I would recommend this pillow to anyone and everyone!"
b'I use this pillow for reading at bed before falling asleep. I place the large section behind my head and then place the two \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d next to me or sometimes across my middle to hold the book in place. When I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to sleep, I actually turn the pillow upside down so that my head is on my own pillow while the \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d snuggle against my back and stomach, since I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper. Very comfortable pillow and quite large! We have a Queen sized bed and it takes up my entire half of the bed - with me sandwiched in the middle of the cushions - which is fine with me. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier with it.'
b"I bought this pillow for my pregnant wife after reading tons of reviews on all different types of pillows. She'd been having difficulty sleeping and pain in her back and hips. She started using this pillow and immediately got a better nights sleep. She is 19 weeks pregnant now and has been using it for about 5 weeks. I will say though, we have a queen bed and it takes up more than half the bed. I'm OK with the sacrifice because she sleeps better."
b'This pillow is AMAZING! I had the Leachco Snoogle pillow for my last pregnancy and hated it. The design is terrible and in a \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 shape that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support your belly when the long part is supporting your back. If you flip it and the long part is supporting your belly in the front, then there is a big gap where your back is and you have to put an extra pillow there.Anyway, I was so glad to find something else out there that actually worked and was comfy. The part where you lay your head is also not too fluffy/full (like the Leachco one) and won\xe2\x80\x99t give you a neck ache.I am going to recommend this pillow to all my pregnant friends in the future. :)'
b'I struggle with back pain from a work injury and this pillow helps so much. It can be used with your head on the cross part or by your ankles. I use a temperpedic pillow so I put the top/cross piece between my ankles. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand for my knees or ankles to rub at night. It helps with lower back support and is just plump enough to be comfortable without being too firm or to large to comfortably use without your neck or shoulders sitting at odd angles. My 4 year old stole it to use in her bed because it makes her feel \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d because she won\xe2\x80\x99t roll out of bed. She never has and has rails on her bed but it takes away a fear she has and she likes to snuggle in the i shape. We had to buy another one because she loved it so much too.'

We will have to see how well it helps me sleep as I get bigger, but so far I have no regrets. I would buy this pillow again!'

b"I've had multiple back surgeries info they past and hard 2 in December of 2017...... I wish I would have found this pillow before because it made my life after surgery a different world. I know it says pregnant pillow but it should say multiple use pillow.  I can adjust this pillow Inn so many ways is unbelievable...I'm 5 foot 8 185 and this pillow allows me to adjust the pillow to take pressure off the area where I have stitches and pain. My head sits at the top and the pillow goes to my knees. I so wish I'd have found this pillow 5 years ago because it has changed my life! It's right around 60 inches long with a zip off cover and its extremely warm. I'd recommend this pillow to anyone! I review items occasionally but l'm  reviewing this item for people who suffer because I know what back pain is like especially after surgery so please believe I didn't waste my time reviewing this item 2 weeks after surgery for no reason! I hope it works for you like it did for me.  I didn't receive anything for this review other than I'd hopefully help someone else! GOOD LUCK!"
b'I was experiencing a lot of hip pain from sleeping on my side so I decided to do research on pregnancy pillows. The ones sold at Babies R Us and other places were insanely expensive. I decided to look on Amazon and I am so happy I decided on this pillow. It came perfect with no rips, tears, or stains. It also included an additional pillow cover! It has helped ease any pain I was having and literally can not be beat for the price. It does take up a bit of room, we have a King sized bed and my husband can\xe2\x80\x99t really hold me at night since it is a full body, but sometimes I wake up to him holding the other side of the pillow because even he loves it!!!! Buy this pillow you will not regret it and your sleep will thank you!!!!'
b"I am a side sleeper.  I cannot afford to get a new mattress right now, so this was a great alternative to get me through,  It is big, and not too bulky.  I don't like my head propped up too much when I sleep, so this is nice.  It is big, so if you have a Queen sized bed, and a partner to sleep with, then be aware it takes up a bit of room.You can easily take the cover off, and wash it, which is nice.  Put some extra care when putting back in the cover, to make sure to keep the same shape.  I like this pillow, and I like that it isn't as expensive as others I have tried.  I ended up returning the Snoogle, and another expensive one.EASY CARE: To clean, simply toss the pillow into the washing machine on a cold, delicate cycle. This extra-long makes a great gift or present for new nursing moms, expecting mothers or baby showers."
b'WOW DO I LOVE THIS BODY PILLOW AND I\xe2\x80\x99M NOT EVEN PREGNANT.I\xe2\x80\x99m a 68 year old Grandma and I just need a little extra support when I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting up in bed reading or watching something on Amazon Prime or Netflix. My favorite configuration is to turn it upside down and make a nest of it  with the side arms up and crossed behind my head. I actually look forward to going and nestling down into it when my back is feeling particularly achy. At night I lay it out with the arms down each side of my body so I can raise and rest my knee ( just like the picture shows) which relieves pain from my arthritic hip. This is one of the best things I have bought in a while. Wish I had had this when I was pregnant, it would have made sleeping so much more comfortable. If you buy it, watch the video for this particular pillow because the different configurations for using it are great. I REALLY LOVE THIS \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f'
b"I wanted to sleep on this pillow for a week before I made my review. I've been sleeping so well. Not everyone sleeps the same. So, if you sleep like my, you're gonna want and need this pillow. I'm a side sleeper and need two pillows as well as one between my legs. Not only has it made my pregnant belly way more comfortable, my neck stopped hurting, and I'm asleep way quicker than usual. It's definitely big, but should fit fine with a queen bed. I love that I can roll over and don't need to bring the pillow with me, I move a lot in my sleep. If you're pregnant, or even if you just want a ridiculously comfortable body pillow I highly recommend."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant but am recovering from spinal fusion surgery. After suffering through a couple weeks of not being able to sleep well, I researched body pillows and found this one. It certainly has helped me sleep better and I\xe2\x80\x99ve even been able to ween myself off pain and sleeping pills because of it. This pillow makes it very comfortable to sleep on your side with the pillow between your legs. When I sleep on my back with it, I put a regular pillow in between the two long \xe2\x80\x9clegs\xe2\x80\x9d of this pillow to go under my knees. My only complaint is that I am 5\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d and I feel like this pillow could be slightly longer for even more comfort and flexibility. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.'
b'In heaven!  Oh how I love my full body pillow ~ and I am not pregnant!  I wish I had one of these when I was though... boy what a snuggly, comfy nights sleep I have had the last few nights since getting my pillow in the mail.  I have a right hip SI joint dysfunction and sleeping with a pillow between my knees was recommended by my doc and I already liked having one by my side, so I thought this would be the best solution and boy was I correct... what a simple joy for me to crawl into bed and have this total comfort wrapped around me.  Thank you so much!'
b"I am really falling in love with this pillow.I am sleeping on a futon with a mattress topper and it really doesn't cut it, but with this pillow I am almost to the point that I don't need a fancy mattress to sleep well. I seem to wake up pretty refreshed and don't notice myself tossing and turning.It is very cushy and plush. You don't quite sink into it, but nearly so. I like that it wraps around you and cradles you on either side. You can either use the middle part under your head or if you reverse it it can go under your knees to help with back pain. Either way is comfortable. You can lay totally on your back, or if you are like me and are not used to that you can lay partly on your side being supported by the cushion.The pillow is BIG. If you are one person that's fine, but I'm not so sure you could fit two comfortably on a normal sized bed.Bottom line is, it is comfortable and I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. I think I will end up buying another one."
b'I read probably a hundred reviews for 10 or so different brands of this pillow. Being a savvy Amazon Prime member, I figured - Hey this is one of the Amazon Favorites - gotta be for a good reason? I scoured through uploads from people who have purchased this product and compared. Right out of the box I love this thing! So does hubby! I am currently 18 weeks pregnant and have reached the point where sleeping has become difficult. No more now! We work opposite shifts so cuddling only happens twice a week and this makes me feel much more comforted while I sleep alone. I can lay on my back and scoot the bottom parts under my knees and sleep so comfortably. Sleeping on your side is delightful.Some people complain its too flat, which I don\'t feel is the case at all. I\'m only 5\'3\'\' so this really fits me super well! You read the reviews that say its like sleeping on a cloud, it legit is. Its not "crunchy" sounding either. I plan to make my own cases for it since I\'m sew savvy, but you can also purchase them if you like.Save your money, get this bad boy. Don\'t go for those $100+ rip offs. Not worth it for the same product.'
b"tried to wash the white slipcover and the foam was falling apart. My fianc\xc3\xa9 and my puppy loves it, but I wasn't using it to its full potential as a pregnant person. Overall, cool pillow - just difficult to fully wash or clean, would need to relook at repacking the filling inside & creating a slipcover for it.Carol from the company notified me immediately and I received a full refund for my purchase. I revised my rating to 5 stars\xe2\x9c\xaf for great customer service. Thank you Carol. \xe2\x99\xa1"
b"Best purchase ever! I wish I was kidding. I have a connective tissue problem and so I bought this pillow to help stabilize my body as I sleep. It has changed my life. The first morning after sleeping with this body pillow I woke up less stiff and more rested. The pillow has a removable cover. (Don't know how it holds up in the wash yet.) The pillow itself is sturdy and supportive, at least for my needs- can't attest to using it w a pregnant belly. Came in vacuum sealed package and had no stains or strange smells."
b"I am 70 years old.  I purchased the pillow because of back pain.  I was sleeping in a chair in the living room.  The pillow has permitted me to return to my bed.  I don't know why it helps with back pain, but it does  I had done everything - from therapy to workouts in the gym and nothing seemed to help the problem. Purchasers might like to know that I can easily sleep on my side. back and also tummy.  I use my neck pillow with it.  I find that it is full enough for my needs. I fold the pillow back to get in and out of bed because it really is a bit much to climb over. I chose this particular one because of its size, (it is long enough), other reviews, and my allergies.  I am happy with it."
b'I am 30 weeks pregnant and was in desperate need of a maternity pillow. I already had tried and returned 3 different pillows before I decided to give this pillow a try.It came in on the time they mentioned and packaging was how it is supposed to be. Its been couple of weeks that I am using this pillow and apart from few issues I am happy with the purchase. The head support is just too big for me but overall the pillow is soft with really nice and sturdy white cover.But I am already noticing few empty spots where I lay my legs. I fluff it everyday before the use but somehow the empty stops just wont fill so now I think not fluffing isn\'t the issue here may be the fibers are separating.I really like this pillow but I guess I have to contact the customer service for this issue which I was hoping not to go through this time after 3 failed attempts of using different pillow.I would still recommend this pillow, because apart from few issues this pillow is amazing for the price I paid and it surly is comfortable.EDIT: It was not even couple days that I posted review and I was contacted by their customer servcie. I was highly impressed with their prompt action and "do whatever it takes" attitude to make a customer happy.I wasn\'t expecting but I was offered a full refund for the pillow, and I gladly accept it and was ready to send the pillow back. But to my surprise, they told me to keep the pillow. I am not the kind of person who would change the review just because I was offered something for free but they were eager to please the customer and thats what won me over. I ended up giving away the pillow to my pregnant sister in law and not using any pillow right now. But I know if I ever want one I am for sure to buy from this company again or recommend anyone who needs it.'
b"I'm 6'0 tall and 20 weeks pregnant, and what a difference this pillow has made! I wasn't sleeping well before with my single full body pillow, but as soon as I started sleeping with this U-shaped pillow, I don't toss and turn all night anymore because my back is supported whichever side I lay on. It's plenty long enough to rest my legs on and I've been sleeping great and feeling rested. No need to spend more, this pillow does what it needs to do!"
b'I could not have survived this pregnancy without this pillow! Especially the farther along and bigger you get. My husband actually suggested/purchased this pillow for me, knowing how uncomfortable I had become and how much trouble I had sleeping at night... I had a C-shaped pregnancy pillow, but I had trouble getting comfortable at night without having support on both sides of my body. This pillow allows support for your ever-growing belly and your back- plus it keeps you on your left side throughout the night. This pillow has kept me napping well, and sleeping comfortably throughout the night. I absolutely love it! Seriously, if you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant and having trouble sleeping, buy this pillow! It will save you!'
b"I searched a bunch of pillows and ultimately decided on this one because of the cost. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on something that I wasn't sure was going to help me sleep any better than the regular pillows I was using.But boy am I glad I bought this. It's helped me stay on my side and supports my growing belly. I don't always sleep great but having this pillow hug me in always helps.I love having a washable cover, I do wish the cover came in colors other than white, but regardless I'm very happy with this purchase."
b"Slept 3 nights with this so far. Absolutely fantastic. I have a bad back and neck. Also issues with heating up at night. I slept like a baby straight through the night. I thought it might be too much but its perfect. I love the feeling of a pillow at my back when i lay on my side. Very comfortable and supportive since rolling over can be difficult when my back is sore.I would love n extra cover or a different color cover. I saw instructions in the q & a's but I couldn't find the link. If seller can help, that would be great."
b"Crawling into my pregnancy pillow after work is the best. I am 5'6 and bought this when I was ~12 weeks pregnant. Now I am at 21 weeks and I have used it every night except for when my partner borrowed it when he tweaked his back (it really helped his back).I gave this 5 stars for versatility because not only does my partner find it useful, but I imagine myself trying this as a nursing pillow in the future too.The cover comes off and machine washes with my sheets. Super easy to get on and off (well.. my partner and I were able to do it in a couple minutes together).I am normally a tummy sleeper and this is the perfect cure. I can't imagine a better pregnancy pillow for myself, though I haven't tried any others!Hope this helps! Cheers!"
b"If I had to choose only three items to take with me to a deserted island, this pillow would be one of them.  I have struggled for years to find something to help me sleep without back pain and after spending tons of money on various pillows, I stumbled across this.  I'm not pregnant but I use it every single night and from the very first night I noticed an improvement in my sleep quality and lessened back pain.-I'm a side sleeper (both sides throughout the night)-This thing is huge even on a queen size bed, so be prepared!-The pillowcase that comes with it is a bit crinkly which I didn't love but I found a replacement fairly easily"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a pregnancy pillow for me.  I got it at the suggestion of my chiropractor who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me tummy sleeping anymore because my neck was all jacked and fuxxored.  This keeps me from rolling over in the night to stomach sleep like I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my entire life.  Guess what?  In two weeks, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake with neck and shoulder pain, and I feel rested and comfortable.I fall asleep almost instantly with this pillow, it is so comfortable.One drawback for other people may be the size\xe2\x80\x94it takes up over half of my queen size bed so sleeping partners might not be keen on that. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a tad bulkly and I have to move it to get around it into bed, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really not an issue for me.Overall, it has elevated my sleep game.  It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely worth it.  I love this thing.'

b"Let's be honest - being pregnant isn't the magical, wonderful journey that your auntie told you it would be. It is a 9 month journey into self-inflicted torture and hell. Your hips hurt, your back hurts, you can't stop farting, and even though you have never been more tired in your life, it is impossible to find a comfortable position to sleep in. That is until the hiccapop came along! This beautiful little wedge might look like a simple pillow, but really it is the greatest creation known to man (and pregnant women). Since I've started using the hiccapop, I am able to sleep comfortably through the night without my aching knees, hips, or back waking me up every few hours. I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed, and ready to face the day (or the 4 hours I make it before needing a nap again because, well, pregnancy). Seriously! Get this little pillow and get sleep while you can!On a side note, when I'm not using it to hoist up my size-of-a-whale baby bump, my dogs find it to be a very comfortable head rest."
b"I've read in multiple forums about the need for a pregnancy pillow but I share a queen bed with my husband and we have no room for bulky pillows. I ordered this wedge pillow when I was about 18 weeks along and although I didn't need it for sleeping yet, I was getting lower back pain while sitting. Wedging this pillow behind my lower back while sitting made a huge difference. Then, by 21 weeks, I was noticing abdomen pain when I would roll over a hundred times in the night so I started using this pillow under my belly at night, too. It's small enough not to be cumbersome when I switch sides all night and versatile enough that I now carry it around with me to the couch, the dining room chairs, and to bed. It's pliable enough to mould to how you need it but rigid enough for good support. Fair warning, you'll want to buy 2 of these."
b'I love this!! It\'s exactly what I was hoping for! I am 27 weeks, and my belly was side-sagging. The maternity body pillow I had (expensive one) had this odd "bump" in the middle which they say can support the belly, but it\'s way too high up! It works better as a back support on the opposite side. So I set out for a wedge. THIS IS THE BEST PILLOW SETUP! I\'ve heard another review state the wedge would be best with another pillow supporting the back. This is true! It keeps you from rolling over also, since you have a wedge on one side. This is so comfortable. I can now simply sit on one side of the wedge to get into bed, and then just lie over on my side, and I\'m perfectly positioned. No more fighting to get comfortable with the pillows! And it\'s so comfy.For anyone interested, I got the large pregnancy minky pillow from pregnancypillow dot com. Be sure to use a discount code!! They have them EVERYWHERE. And they save like $40 or something. Go google it!In my before and after shot, it\'s easier to tell the difference it makes in person. But look at my belly button for reference! It lifts the belly nicely!For reference, we have a cali-king bed.'
b"Great pillow- I had the boppy wedge pillow before with multiple pregnancies which was good , but this one  has many more options. It's SO much better than a body pillow when you're turning over in bed- you just bring it with you! Wedge pillows are the way to go - this is the best I've tried so far:)"
b"This is exactly what I needed. I didn't want to pay over $100 for a huge full body pillow. I have lovely pillows that my head is very happy with! I simply needed support for my 5 month twin bump. I love that it has 2 sides; soft and harder with memory foam. At the moment the softer side is perfect but I am likely to need to more solid side as I get bigger. I also like that the supporting information sheet gives you ideas for other uses for the pillow (e.g. In between your legs) and I can carry it around the house easily for additional support; I've even popped it behind my back in my home office chair. For such a small cost, it had so many uses. I'm delighted to tried this before taking the plunge for a big body pillow and I feel it will be used consistently in many ways over the next 3 months!Finally, and not something I would typically comment on, but I loved the additional correspondence and follow up emails from the company. I usually ignore these and don't always review but the great product and messaging of the company made me want to support them. I am one very satisfied customer!"
b"This pillow is amazing! I have a giant maternity body pillow that I spent a lot of money on and quite frankly it wasn't cutting it! It wasn't really supporting my belly as much as I needed and I was waking up a lot due to discomfort. I was having horrible back pain (especially getting out of bed in the morning). I've only had this pillow a few days and already notice a huge difference and I have not been waking up at night!This pillow is so comfortable and I love that it has two different sides of firmness. I saw another review complained about the zipper being uncomfortable but it actually isn't an issue. The cover comes off and you can flip the inside cushion over so the zipper will be on the bottom if you prefer to use the side that is firm.I pretty much carry this around the house with me. It's perfect for resting on the couch or sleeping in bed. I am so, so happy I bought this pillow!"
b'To be honest, I didn\'t use this much for most of my pregnancy. I tried it a few times, it didn\'t seem to do much. My bump stayed reasonably compact, and the pillow was a little big for me. Even if I tucked it right up under my bra strap area, it would still come down far enough to force me to move my (bent) knees down to make room for it. I still wish it was a little shorter and the slope a little less steep. (I\'m 5\'6", 125 pounds pre-pregnancy.)But in the ninth month, I suddenly started having trouble sleeping. My body just felt "off," and I couldn\'t drift off and felt really miserable. I decided to give this thing a try again, and I\'m so glad I did! I can sleep through the night now (well, except for at least three trips to the bathroom). So worth it to be able to get decent sleep in the run-up to birth and having a baby keep me up all night for entirely different reasons ;)'
b'This is a super light weight pillow thats great for travel and can be easily moved around the house for watching TV or reading a book.  I like that it has the two different sides with 2 levels of firmness.  I have been having issues with right hip pain that makes it very painful to lay on my side, but after getting this wedge, I am able to "wedge" it under my right back/butt and it keeps me from being completely flat on my back but also allows by legs to remain outstretched and comfortable.'
b'First of all, I object to the name "hiccapop Pregnancy Pillow Wedge for Maternity..."If properly marketed, this incredible device would find a grateful customer base in body alignment wedges, hip and back support wedges for side sleepers, etc..That said, I have been bedridden for over a year and have tried several body aligner wedges of various descriptions, none of which worked for me, they were too big, or slipped out from under me... there just isn\'t anything that is thin enough, on the thin edge of the wedge, or soft enough to stay in place.In other words, this is a miracle find!  There is a huge market for a wedge like this, but it shouldn\'t just be marketed as a pregnancy aid, I know men with serious lumbar problems who would never buy it, just because of the name, I\'m a woman and don\'t like the name, but the product is OUTSTANDING!!It is thin enough to wedge under (where ever you want to wedge it) and the angle is perfect for it to stay there, also the memory foam and the soft velvety cover help to keep it from sliding out, the memory foam is soft enough so that it molds to your body and the velvety cover has enough traction to grip the surface you are on and not slide out from under you!This is a long needed MEDICAL device, the quality of which just doesn\'t exist elsewhere!If you need hip support or lumbar support, or if you are a side sleeper, but can\'t stay on your side for medical reasons or lack of body strength or balance, and need SUPPORT, you have FINALLY found it!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS A BODY ALIGNMENT WEDGE!!!'
b'At 34 weeks pregnant I started to really feel the magnitude of my second pregnancy with much aches and pains and round ligament pain. My first pregnancy I had one of those obnoxiously huge maternity pillows that ended up falling flat toward the end of my pregnancy, not to mention it was expensive! I opted to try something different and this little wedge was a game changer for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sleeping muuuuuch better. It\xe2\x80\x99s size is also small and convienant allowing me to use it when I set up in bed or on my glider for my lower back and sometimes in between my knees when I needed a little extra support when the siatica pain creeps in at night every now and then.'
b"I don't often write reviews, but when a product is as great as the hiccapop I just have to share.  I was about 27 weeks when it started to get uncomfortable to sleep on my side (even with the pregnancy body pillow I'd been using).  My back was so sore in the morning.  This little wedge pillow has been a life (sleep) saver.  It gives just the right support for my bump without taking up too much space.  I noticed the difference the very first day.  It also doubles as a nice back support for prolonged periods of sitting.  I love my hiccapop and would highly recommend!!!"
b"I love this. I have been having low back pain during my pregnancy and ordered a snoogle. The snoogle helped me not roll onto my back and side sleep, but it didn't help my back pain. Then I ordered the wedge and this does help when I sleep with it under my belly. It's soft and easy to travel with too, so when I travel I only need to take the wedge and leave the snoogle at home. The wedge and a pillow behind my back so I don't roll onto it are the basics that I need.Just an FYI, when I first used the wedge I still had back pain. I thought it didn't work. But then I shoved it further underneath my belly and it helped a lot. I just didn't tuck it under enough to make an impact - but now that I've figured this out, I'm feeling much better."
b'I am currently seven months pregnant with twins and have been on the go including a lot of flights.  This pillow has been with me every step of the way.  When I fly, it provides great back support and folds into a small little bag.  At hotels and outside of my home, I have been able to wedge it under my stomach at night to provide extra support.I am now staying closer to home as my due date approaches but I still sleep with the pillow in my bed every night. I use it as a backrest when I am propped up reading before bed and also sometimes put it between my legs as my hips and back are starting to get more sore.  Long story short, this thing is lifesaver and I have found it useful in a myriad of different ways!'
b'6 Month pregnant.  Use it every night! Makes sitting up and lying on my side extremely comfortable!  I have used the big pregnancy pillow previously, but could never get comfortable and eventually ditched it, which is upsetting because those pillows are expensive.  This allows my husband to snuggle close to me!  Love it!  Folds very neatly in its little bag.  No chemical smell like some of the other wedges out there.'
b"been using this since end of first trimester and yes, it's lovely. it also travels easily (smushes into suitcase) so I don't have to try to make a pillow work where the wedge does a much better job. it's a little big for my torso (long) and sometimes i have to fuss with it in the night to get it in the right spot, but i like that i don't have a pillow fortress around me isolating me from my husband."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I went ahead and bought this! My maternity pillow was too bulky to stick under the side of my belly and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable until I bought this one. I had my baby at the end of October and I  was so happy to have it when I got home from the hospital, I had to have a C-section so it offered a lot of support during my healing process also. I still use it for support when I\xe2\x80\x99m side sleeping either in between my knees or for my back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t  hesitate to make this purchase you will thank yourself for it!'
b'I bought 2 pillows, one for my pregnant friend and one for my husband who has back problems. My friend loves it, she is 34 weeks pregnant and has been using it for the past 2 weeks. My husband uses it but thinks that the memory foam is too soft to properly support his knees. He places it between his knees while lying on his side to keep his pelvis aligned.I personally think it would be good for travelling because it can be squashed into the carry bag (very useful) and would provide good support to sit on for longer flights.'
b"After I hit 30 weeks my sleep quality dropped tremendously. By week 31 I found this pillow and ordered it. It's been extremely helpful with not just my sleep, but driving and sitting at a desk while I'm at work. I'm really glad I bought it and would recommend to other. The big body pillow was helpful before, but for some reason after I hit 30 weeks I moved a lot more and it stopped being helpful. The wedge shape of this pillow supports my growing belly so much better, that I'm not tossing and turning like I used to."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using my old u-shaped pregnancy pillow for years now, but as I\xe2\x80\x99m over halfway through my second pregnancy I felt I needed more support. This pillow provided great support for my growing belly as I sleep on my left side. One side is soft, one side is slightly firmer. It has a removable, machine washable cover too. I occupy a significant portion of the bed now as I have a head pillow, my u-shaped pregnancy pillow and this hiccapop wedge pillow. They all provide the comfort I need to sleep well at night. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy with my purchase!'
b'A towel folded just right was just as comfortable, but getting it folded just right and keeping it that was as I moved through the night was a real pain, and this wedge is a great substitute.  Really helps with being comfortable through the night with belly support.I don\'t know what everyone else is talking about regarding a "hard" side and soft side, both sides are identical as far as I can tell.Fits just right and easy to move around with me through the night!'

b"My husband is well aware of the fact that this pillow has now replaced him. I made it to my third trimester not needing a support pillow, then one day my spawn kept flipping me like a pancake onto my back. Deciding that a battle of wills with an unborn hellion was going to result in me losing every single time, I dragged this down from the guest room and now I'm in love and leaving my husband to start my new life with my pregnancy pillow. It will just be the two of us (and I guess the baby? Maybe?) relaxing on the beach, sleeping soundly, wrapped around each other like little monkeys, with not a care in the world and not an ache in our spines.This pillow is literally what gets me through the day. Whether I'm sleeping curled up with it, or whether I'm at work dreaming of when I get home and can curl up in it's sweet, supportive embrace, this pillow gets me through some crazy days. I almost weep for joy when I go into my room and see it laying there, waiting to swallow me up in its....arms? Let's go with arms. Otherwise I'm sleeping with my head in a pillows crotch (although that wouldn't taint my love for it one bit).Oh, and the fact that I can pull out stuffing or shove it back in means that not even the irrational whims of a cranky, salty, mercurial pregnant woman can defeat this pillow. Too fluffy? RIP OUT SOME STUFFING AND PRETEND IT'S THAT WOMAN WHO SAID IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING TWINS WHEN YOU SO ARE NOT!! Not enough support? SHOVE SOME STUFFING BACK IN AND PRACTICE THREATENING YOUR OFFSPRING THAT YOU CAN SEND THEM BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM!!I had originally promised to pass this pillow on to a friend after my pregnancy but now I think I'm going to enter the Witness Protection Program with it because I'm sure as hell not giving it up."
b"After reading the other reviews I really didn't understand how any negativity could come from this pillow. No bed bugs, no it wasn't flat (by far the most fluffiest yet firm pillow ever!) and it has been nothing but a blessing! Im 28 weeks pregnant and my hips, ribs and back are constantly in pain.. but after a few nights sleep with my new pillow I get a full 9-10 hours of sleep (not counting the times to go potty), and I could also sit on my couch pain free with it too! My husband wants me to get him one too after taking a nap with it. I didn't even sleep this well when I wasnt pregnant! I'm also 5'8 and the height is a perfect fit for my body! Very, very happy customer and more than satisfied!"
b'I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 88 year old Mother who has severe arthritis.  She has used it every night since Dec. 25 & she said she loves it.  It gives her good neck & head support plus her back.  Since she is a widow & sleeps alone, she tends to get cold.  But this pillow cradles her & keeps her warm also.  She loves it!  She wondered why I was giving her a "pregnancy" pillow!!!  LOL!  She had a good laugh but I explained how I had read that it might help her.  She agrees now!  I highly recommend this for other reasons besides "pregnancy"!  Thank you!'
b'I bought this pillow on 2017 Black Friday weekend, exactly one day after the SALE was over (talk about bad timing?). I was 24 weeks pregnant and I was already uncomfortable every night, although my bump was not so big. I did a lot of pregnancy pillow research before I bought this item and after I read the bad reviews for this product, I was inclined not to purchase it anymore. However, my hubby convinced me to try it and I did it!  I purchased the product on Saturday, regular shipping and I was pleasantly surprised to find it delivered on Monday afternoon. Package looked perfect, easy to open, pillow was brand new, super clean, although I rarely do that with I new purchase, I started using it right away, without even washing the cover. The instructions were simple and clear and I was notified that I have to wait for a while before the pillow goes to its original shape (as it was vacuum sealed). My sleep quality increased tremendously, I would recommend this item to all pregnant women that have trouble sleeping. We own a king size bed and it takes just 50% of it, yes it is bulky and firm, but this is what I was looking for. I am 5\'8-1/2" and fairly "skinny" for a pregnant lady , but I have no complaint about the length and I can tell you my baby is not letting me sleep with my knees as high as the picture shows, he always kicks me and dictates the angle of my thighs. The pillow didn\'t lose its shape 2 months later and I am actually rotating sides each week and I wash the cover every month. The first time we tried to put the cover back it worked like a charm (but I really needed my husband\'s help). The second time I washed it, we were tired and lost our technique so we kind of hassled but not the pillow\'s fault that we weren\'t thinking right at 11 pm. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and I am recommending this pillow to everyone. This is the first time I used a pregnancy pillow and I am not paid for this review.'
b'I\'m not sure why this got some bad reviews. I did a LOT of searching for a pregnancy pillow, and they all come with very mixed reviews. Ultimately after a personal recommendation, I decided on this one. I was worried since the negative reviews specified that it seemed very small and not long enough. I\'m definitely not a small person (plus-sized gal) and I\'m 5\'6", and this works great for me. I am about 4.5 months pregnant and I was starting to get backaches from sleeping, plus I\'m a back sleeper and I kept finding myself on my back through the night.Sleeping with this pillow is like sleeping in a cloud. I thought I\'d hate the filling but it\'s very soft, and not at all lumpy. I don\'t find the neck too high, in fact I put another pillow between my head and this one (granted it\'s a very flat squishy down one). As mentioned, I\'m 5\'6", and while this doesn\'t go all the way to my feet like in the picture, it does hit a little below my knees which is plenty to just keep my hips aligned and to stuff the end of this between my knees.  For those who do want a much bigger one, there does exist a bigger pillow by this same Queen Rose brand, which I\'d have gotten if I didn\'t have a queen-sized bed.  Unfortunately my husband still needs a space :-) This one fits great and he still has plenty of room to sleep.Also, this isn\'t only for pregnant women - my husband loves sleeping in this when I\'m not around, and he said lying in it makes him fall asleep immediately. I only wish I had selected a different color; I only noticed I could get white or gray after I already ordered with the default pink and blue. It\'s a little gaudy. But the cover isn\'t a bad texture at all as some others said - I find it very comfy as is, right out of the package.Oh and it was really fun to open the vacuum-sealed package and watch it spring up into a big fluffy pillow. When it first arrives it definitely looks wilted and flat :)  All in all, great pillow, and totally saving my sleep while pregnant!'
b'I am obsessed! Soon as it came out of the package that kept it flat, it poofed right up. And the grey cover is so soft. You can fluff it up for more support and it\xe2\x80\x99s very versatile. Takes up half the bed so hubby is still fine, maybe just a little jealous lol. He just ends up cuddling the side I\xe2\x80\x99m not using! Recommend this to anyone!'
b"I bought this and the mama bee belly butter combo for my first time expecting wife as a surprise and she lovessss both of them!! She especially loves the body pillow. She says it's so comfortable and helps with knee, back, and neck pain, as well helps her sleep better at night. Definitely recommend for expecting moms and if you're the soon to be dad reading this BUY IT FOR HER SHE'LL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE!!"
b'***updating my review because the seller was fantastic** This pillow wasn\'t for me probably because of my prior spinal and hip problems. The seller offered me the larger version but I just don\'t have space in my bed for it. But they did everything to try to make me happy and ultimately I\'m glad I tried this out. Thanks Queen Rose! I\'d say if you\'re 5\'6" or over get the larger version.I spent forever searching reviews of pregnancy pillows before picking one because I already had back and hip problems prior to pregnancy. This one seemed like a great option in theory but after about a month of use I\'m convinced I don\'t particularly like it. The padding in the pillow is kind of uneven throughout and its incredibly difficult to change positions in it. I wish it was a little longer because I always feel like I\'m tugging it to try to support my legs, and my hip pain has gotten worse if anything since using it, and now I often wake with rib and shoulder pain from the weird position I end up in.  It\'s not a bad pillow. It\'s well constructed, maybe I\'m just not a fan of the u shape style, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for ladies with spinal and hip issues.'
b"This pillow is incredible. I am in my 5th month of pregnancy and even though my tummy isn't huge yet I was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I would toss and turn. My back and hips would hurt throughout the day, I would wake up with headaches, and always be exhausted (and cranky)! This pillow has changed all of that! No joke the first night I slept with this thing I got better sleep than I had in two months. I woke up feeling rested and ready for the day. My back and hips no longer hurt. I didn't wake up nearly as much at night and frankly I am just in a better mood overall because I finally got some sleep! I put off buying this pillow and now I wish I would have had it all the time!"
b'I am over 50 so I am, obviously, not pregnant.  I bought this since I have a hard time getting comfortable and always use 5 or 6 pillows to try to sleep.  This product is so comfortable, that I can finally get some good sleep.  I bought one for my daughter too and she loves it too. It is not just for pregnant people. I also use it to watch TV in bed by crisscrossing the lower parts Good quality.'

b'I am a stomach sleeper so being pregnant is a giant sleeping pain for me. I had to adjust to sleeping on my side but I hate having just a pillow between my knees. I kept getting sciatica in my left hip/butt cheek while sleeping and had to figure something out. I researched a lot of pregnancy pillows and decided on this one 1) because it gives me the ability to rollover and be supported on both sides(I toss alot) and 2) the multiple good reviews. Let me tell you this pillow is worth all 5 stars! It is so comfortable and supports me perfectly while sleeping. I\'ve had it a little over a month and sleep so much better now. I love that I can cuddle it and it\'s not too hot or heavy to keep my arms under. I can push the opposite side behind my back for support and lay facing up a bit comfortably. I can tuck the sides under my legs or butt if I need extra support too - it\'s so amazing! Even my husband loves the pillow and tried to steal it from me after he had ACL surgery and was stuck on the couch. I am definitely going to be using this long after giving birth. Also,  I am 5\'8" and it\'s just about the max length for me to use properly with my legs. It might be a bit less comfy for a taller woman but then again everyone\'s body shape and sleeping positions vary. Don\'t let that discourage you I would still give it a try! I\'m probably going to buy one for my husband and daughter as well because they both love it as much as me lol.'
b"I'm not pregnant.  I'm 68 and I have 6 herniated discs, kyphosis, scoliosis -- serious curves in my spine.  I don't have a medicare doctor with much enthusiasm for helping.  They say use tylenol and heat or ice depending on the talking head so I decided to try a body pillow.  Hard to discern between all the choices, but I picked this one due to reviews and price.  It is nothing short of a miracle.  I am able to sleep lying down on the bed because I don't ever have to let my spine be flat on the bed, I can prop myself up for support.  I can change sides with ease, even sleep partly on my back.  The first night, I slept 10 hours and never moved my position once.  I am so grateful for this relief.  And sleep makes a world of difference healing from this latest bout with a thoracic disk i.e. huge difficulty breathing.  I will never be without it again.  Thanks Queen Rose."
b"Back and neck pain has been 75% better with this. I am 37, 5'11', with arthritis and some deteriorating discs, brand new high end mattress wasn't completely cutting it, this has helped so much!"
b"This pillow is by far the most amazing pillow I have ever used. Of all the products I have bought during my pregnancy to make myself more comfortable, this one takes the cake! I suffer from hormone related insomnia so sleeping has pretty much always been an issue for me, but with this pillow, I am so relaxed and comfortable that I've have been sleeping almost normally. I had a C-shaped body pillow before I found this one and only used it once because of how much I toss and turn at night. With the U-shaped pillow, I can turn over and don't have to worry about trying to flip the pillow with me. I honestly look forward to coming home and laying down now which has never been the case. I would recommend this pillow to anyone and everyone!"
b'I use this pillow for reading at bed before falling asleep. I place the large section behind my head and then place the two \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d next to me or sometimes across my middle to hold the book in place. When I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to sleep, I actually turn the pillow upside down so that my head is on my own pillow while the \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d snuggle against my back and stomach, since I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper. Very comfortable pillow and quite large! We have a Queen sized bed and it takes up my entire half of the bed - with me sandwiched in the middle of the cushions - which is fine with me. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier with it.'
b"I bought this pillow for my pregnant wife after reading tons of reviews on all different types of pillows. She'd been having difficulty sleeping and pain in her back and hips. She started using this pillow and immediately got a better nights sleep. She is 19 weeks pregnant now and has been using it for about 5 weeks. I will say though, we have a queen bed and it takes up more than half the bed. I'm OK with the sacrifice because she sleeps better."
b'This pillow is AMAZING! I had the Leachco Snoogle pillow for my last pregnancy and hated it. The design is terrible and in a \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 shape that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support your belly when the long part is supporting your back. If you flip it and the long part is supporting your belly in the front, then there is a big gap where your back is and you have to put an extra pillow there.Anyway, I was so glad to find something else out there that actually worked and was comfy. The part where you lay your head is also not too fluffy/full (like the Leachco one) and won\xe2\x80\x99t give you a neck ache.I am going to recommend this pillow to all my pregnant friends in the future. :)'
b'I struggle with back pain from a work injury and this pillow helps so much. It can be used with your head on the cross part or by your ankles. I use a temperpedic pillow so I put the top/cross piece between my ankles. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand for my knees or ankles to rub at night. It helps with lower back support and is just plump enough to be comfortable without being too firm or to large to comfortably use without your neck or shoulders sitting at odd angles. My 4 year old stole it to use in her bed because it makes her feel \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d because she won\xe2\x80\x99t roll out of bed. She never has and has rails on her bed but it takes away a fear she has and she likes to snuggle in the i shape. We had to buy another one because she loved it so much too.'
b'I am a stomach sleeper, so pregnancy makes sleeping very difficult for me. I swore after my first pregnancy I would have to do something different as most nights I would end up on the couch after not being able to find a comfortable position. I bought this pillow 10 weeks into my second pregnancy and have slept in my bed every night! (I am now 20 weeks along). I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t like sleeping on my side, but this pillow supports my back and stomach and I like to put it in between my legs. I am able to sleep through the night! It does get a little warm, as the fabric is kind of fuzzy, but it makes such a difference in helping me sleep that it\xe2\x80\x99s not too big a deal to be a little warm. I also had to remove a little of the stuffing as it was too firm for my liking. I would also note that it is very large! I have a king size bed, so my husband still has plenty of room, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much room there would be on a queen. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it, a girl needs her beauty sleep, no? We will have to see how well it helps me sleep as I get bigger, but so far I have no regrets. I would buy this pillow again!'

b'I am not pregnant. I deal with fibro and RA pain in my shoulder blade.1. It came squished, but fluffed very quickly. I actually took a nap with it about an hour after and it was so comfy and then later it fluffed more!2. That nap - OMGosh! The best sleep I have gotten in years! I suffer fibromyalgia and do not take pain medication. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable and sleep is key, but it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible. Not with this baby!!!3. It is giant, but oddly not. We have a queen bed and my partner is a big sleeper. This pillow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt her takeover. She is able to spread out and I am able to still sleep comfortable. We I am cuddled in it we (the pillow and I) still take less space than a twin size bed.4. At this price I figure if it stays fluffy for five or six months I am happy. We spend money on so many things these days - sleep is def worth the investment. If I do have to replace I will update and let you know when. (I will also convert the old pillow to a dog bed because my big dogs are obsessed.)'
b"First of all I am not pregnant... I have been told I need hip replacement surgery, knee replacement surgery and have had neck surgery and back surgery but due to a car wreck I've been advised additional surgery would be necessary. Anyhow my nights are very long, sleepless and painful. I have found God's Word is helping more than anything regarding healing but as I'm learning how to receive my healing... this pillow is absolutely AMAZING!!! I can move it into a million different positions to relieve pain and also restless leg syndrome. I love that the outer cover is removable so I can wash it. Also the cover is great quality it's thick...almost as thick as a sweatshirt."
b'I have shoulder and back problems from lifting a 95 lbs disabled person all day. I have tried muscle relaxers, physical therapy, and was talking about injections with my doctor. I decided to procrastinate and get this pillow to see if it would properly support me while I sleep so everything could relax and repair while I slept. I\'m so glad I did! I got made fun of for buying a "pregnancy pillow" but it was able to keep my shoulders at the proper position AND let me tuck the "arms" behind my knees to help my back (side note I am 5\'2) . This pillow (in addition to meds and physical therapy) has ceased the need for the injections. Even if you aren\'t pregnant, this is a GREAT support pillow! It\'s firm enough to keep its shape but squishy enough that it\'s soft and perfectly cuddly.'
b"Hi. I'm 14 weeks pregnant with my third baby. Have a new amazing tempurpedic cool technology mattress (which I normally sleep great on) and two $200 pillows. I though this pregnancy I will sleep like a baby! Nope! Along with my bump showing up earlier so did all my aches and pains and bedtime restlessness. His pillow didn't have too many reviews but I wanted the grey jersey fabric cover. I swear no matter what my position on this thing I feel great. I sleep better and my butt got smaller (just kidding). When I read I put another pillow under the head part and it's so comfy. I'm actually terrified that something will happen to it and came back here to think about ordering a backup just incase. Oh and it's not too huge like some of the other ones I was looking at. It's great all around."
b"I cannot say enough good things about this body pillow. Once I hit 3.5 months pregnant, I was having major trouble falling asleep. I have a broken back that, combined with the usual aches and pains of pregnancy, made it nearly impossible for me to find a comfortable sleeping position. It would seriously take me 3-4 hours to fall asleep at night. I ordered this body pillow, and every night I've fallen asleep within 3-5 minutes of getting in bed. The firmness is enough that it supports my back and neck no matter which position I choose to sleep in, and I'm finally able to fall asleep quickly and sleep through the night. I also love that it comes with a cover that makes it easy to wash, because I swear I can smell EVERYTHING these days so I always need everything to be super clean. I would highly recommend this body pillow to anyone with back pains or pregnancy insomnia!"
b"I have been using this pillow for almost 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with it.  At 12 weeks pregnant, I already felt uncomfortable sleeping on my back (I have really low blood pressure) and switched to side sleeping.  I tried putting a pillow between my knees but that only helped a bit so I decided to look into getting a pregnancy pillow early (I love my sleep).  I am amazed at how much this pillow help me... having one side to lean against with my back or one side with my stomach allow me to make small adjustments (like straightening my legs out more or one completely out plus shifting the weight from just one point on my hip to more on my butt or thighs) that seem to make all the difference in my sleep quality.  When I was doing the one pillow between my leg thing, I would wake up 4 times a night to shift or would wake up on my back, this pillow solves all of that.  I still wake up once to pee, but that just comes with the territory.Also of importance, this pillow was clean and odorless as soon as I pulled it out of it's packaging... no chemical/factory smell.  The pillow case is nice and soft.  And I was worried that I wouldn't like the head support since I'm slightly picky when it comes to pillow, but it is perfectly comfortable so I had zero trouble adjusting.  This is all upside, ladies, so treat yourself and get this pillow sooner than later!"
b"I'm 25 weeks pregnant and really enjoying this pillow! I'm normally a back/stomach sleeper so I've been really struggling to sleep comfortably on my side. I first purchased the Snoogle after a friend recommended it. I wanted to love it, it was great quality. But I could not get past the shape. My head wasn't comfortable and I didn't like having to flip it over in the middle of the night if I changed sides. THIS however, is like a hug all night long! I can change sides comfortably without struggling to flip the pillow. I would probably rate quality itself as a 4- it's not bad, but doesn't feel quite as high quality as the Snoogle. However, it is comfortable and I am sleeping far better with this! It makes it easier to fall and stay asleep, so 5 stars from this pregnant lady!! Highly recommend.Update: I am now 35 weeks pregnant and am more thankful for this pillow than ever. It's the only reason that I sleep at all these days. Best purchase I've made in a long time (which is saying a lot because I've bought a lot here lately!!)."
b'I don\'t know what possessed me to buy this pillow, I saw it and thought "wow that looks comfy"! I was right, it is comfy and I absolutely love it. I am WAY past the child bearing age so I recommend it to anyone male or female who wants a good nights sleep. It\'s snugly and comfortable and so far has kept it loft and shape. My 15 year old grandson loves to lay on my bed and watch TV while laying inside it. Last night my 7 year old granddaughter spent the night and wanted to sleep with it. She loved it so much that she asked me to get one for her in pink. You can still move around and change sides without difficulty. I use it and one bed pillow under my head without any stiff neck what\'s so ever.'
b"Update:I used this pillow after my hips started to bother me very early on in my pregnancy.I don't think you need to be pregnant to use this. Actually I wish I would have used it years ago.But it definitely worked for my hip discomfort. And as I am about to give birth soon, I can say it works wonderfully in the third trimester. Zero regrets for getting this product. A definite must have in pregnancy.The company does not use flame retardants or chemicals in their pillows. This is something few people think about. You should. Especially when you start buying baby products (clothes especially polyester is a problem, car seat, bassinets, crib mattress, etc) because of the scientific data that details the negative health effects of these chemicals in our babies. Do your research. For adults mattresses and pillows are where we get exposed to flame retardants the most.Anyways, I contacted the company directly and they send me this:Thank you  for your reply. None of our pillows use flame retardants and/or chemicals, you could use it with confidence.Please contact us anytime if you have any questions.Have a nice day!Best regards,AngQiOriginal Review:I have been using this for a bit. I have to say this has made a huge difference in the quality of my sleep. I am able to find a comfortable position easily and at some point you have to sleep sideways when you're preggo and this helps with that! My hips also don't hurt as much while sleeping. But I have preggo induced hip soreness so no pillow or gadget will fix that. However, this pillow is amazing! Even my significant other tries to steal it from me. Good luck to him >=)."
b"Very, very pleased with this pregnancy pillow!  I had purchased a different U-shaped pillow late in my last pregnancy that I loved (wish I had ordered sooner!), but it didn't come with a removable/washable cover.  These pillows take up a lot of space, so I got rid of it shortly after I stoped nursing.  As soon as I found I was expecting again, I placed my order for this pillow.  So glad I did!  I purchased the 55 inch U-shaped full body with the jersey knit cotton cover.  Package came vacuum sealed and the pillow popped right up upon opening.  It's a very full pillow (which I absolutely love) and gives great back support.  I removed the cover that was easy to replace back on after being washed and dried.  I'm petite at 5' and the 55 inch size fits me just right.  Love the light, soft jersey cover and grey color.  Highly recommend!"
b'I myself am not pregnant but am a side sleeper. I find myself able to get comfortable faster as opposed to tossing and turning to find that restful position. My boyfriend enjoys it as well and I find him somehow "ending up in it." I\'m 5\'2" him 5\'5". I feel like it\'s a great length whereas you can adjust the arms into multiple positions with ease . Poofy, firm, dense, and comfortable!! Quality hasn\'t failed. I like all the accessibility you get with removable cover and ability to adjust filling to your liking. I\'m glad I chose this brand after shopping around. I\'ve bought two more for my sister\'s.'
b'I am 6mon pregnant and was unable to sleep well at night. Tried to use an extra pillow to help support my belly but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work that well. My belly is not big comparing to most of the moms, but I felt gassy and my back hurts occasionally. I feel extremely satisfied after using this pillow - it feels like .... sleeping on the cloud. I temoved all other pillows in my bed, put my head on the U shaped area and snuggle with the legs. So comfy!The only thing I feel a bit awkward is to put the pillow back to the pillow case after I washed the case. The legs are bulky and it takes some time to squeeze them in the case.'
b"After reading all the reviews for all the U-shaped body pillow I jumped out the window and bought this one and DEFINITELY made the right decision. It's not too bulky doesn't take up all the space in our queen size bed. Definitely has volume, if it flattens out I will update my review."
b"I'm a massage therapist and I purchased this for use with my prenatal clients. I use it conjunction with a wedge pillow. My clients refer to it as the cocoon, or sometimes the moat. I tested out my own set up and let me tell you, it's super cozy! It provides just enough back support and neck support, and let's you flip easily from side to side without having to drag a full body pillow with you. The cover is a full cotton jersey with a nice stretch, and replacements are available so I can have multiple covers and use one while the other is soiled. So far, the oil I use has only done minimal staining."
b"This pillow saved me! I was not sleeping AT ALL. Tossing, turning couldn't get comfortable. I am not pregnant, I just needed additional support for my back which this provides and has helped ease hip and leg aches. It also keeps me in one spot so I don't wake myself up constantly moving around, but allows me to easily maneuver if I need too and I fall right back to sleep. My dogs love it too. I will often find them snuggled up in the middle of it under the blanket. Have no issue with the fluff. I throw it in the dryer every other time I wash the cover and flip it over often sleeping on both sides."
b'You need one of these! This is seriously The Best purchase I have made for pregnancy. I am on my fourth pregnancy and wished I would have gotten this sooner. It makes sleeping so much more comfortable. I love that it has side support, and back support.  My legs haven\'t gotten charlie horses since they are popped up a bit. I have had it for a few month now and a 30 weeks.  Sleep is getting tougher, but I can\'t imagine getting much without this pillow!I am excited to try it out later with nursing.Cover comes off, so easy to wash. Comfortabl3 and good length for my 5\'11" frame'
b'This is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on or with....that includes my husband (sorry babe).  I am not pregnant but I do have chronic pain in my right shoulder from the way I contort myself at night.  The flexibility of this pillow provides cozy support like you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe and just from the time I have spent snuggled up tonight, napping and reading; I can already feel a difference. I feel like I will need to start bringing a separate suitcase for it on my business trips!  Tonight will be my first full night sleeping on it, so I will report in more as an update.  Oh and P.s.  it\xe2\x80\x99s BIG!!  We have a king size bed so it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.  But it def takes up the space of a flexible, squishy person.  Be aware of that.'
b"Why did I wait so long to buy this?!?! I tossed and turned all night long for several months during my pregnancy and finally bought it when I was 6 months along. I still have to roll over and get readjusted a few times during the night but it has helped me so much. I didn't like the use it like the picture shows. I like my pillow so I use it upside down (like a U) and it works great. My husband is also happy I'm not moving so much at night and waking him up in the process! I was afraid it would take over our queen sized bed but it really doesn't. My husband has plenty of room on his side still."
b"I bought this for my wife that is 9 weeks pregnant and was really struggling to get comfortable enough to really get some rest. I bought this pillow for her birthday and she has commented how comfortable it is and how she has slept more now with it because she can get comfortable and get some sleep. I read the reviews and she hasn't commented that it goes flat at all. I did open the vacuum bag it came in and let the pillow expand but about an hour after I opened the packaging I washed and dried the pillow. It was very fluffy and full after I did so. I would recommend buying this pillow to help you sleep"
b"I was hesitant to buy a pillow because my other friends said they didn't really like them but I'm so happy I did. I've had horrible back pain for the past few weeks of my pregnancy and I'm normally a stomach sleeper. This pillow has been perfect. Its not to hard or soft. It was perfectly supportive for you to get comfortable. It came packaged great. It was air sealed and only expanded when opened so it was easy to carry in the house."

b"My husband is well aware of the fact that this pillow has now replaced him. I made it to my third trimester not needing a support pillow, then one day my spawn kept flipping me like a pancake onto my back. Deciding that a battle of wills with an unborn hellion was going to result in me losing every single time, I dragged this down from the guest room and now I'm in love and leaving my husband to start my new life with my pregnancy pillow. It will just be the two of us (and I guess the baby? Maybe?) relaxing on the beach, sleeping soundly, wrapped around each other like little monkeys, with not a care in the world and not an ache in our spines.This pillow is literally what gets me through the day. Whether I'm sleeping curled up with it, or whether I'm at work dreaming of when I get home and can curl up in it's sweet, supportive embrace, this pillow gets me through some crazy days. I almost weep for joy when I go into my room and see it laying there, waiting to swallow me up in its....arms? Let's go with arms. Otherwise I'm sleeping with my head in a pillows crotch (although that wouldn't taint my love for it one bit).Oh, and the fact that I can pull out stuffing or shove it back in means that not even the irrational whims of a cranky, salty, mercurial pregnant woman can defeat this pillow. Too fluffy? RIP OUT SOME STUFFING AND PRETEND IT'S THAT WOMAN WHO SAID IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING TWINS WHEN YOU SO ARE NOT!! Not enough support? SHOVE SOME STUFFING BACK IN AND PRACTICE THREATENING YOUR OFFSPRING THAT YOU CAN SEND THEM BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM!!I had originally promised to pass this pillow on to a friend after my pregnancy but now I think I'm going to enter the Witness Protection Program with it because I'm sure as hell not giving it up."
b"After reading the other reviews I really didn't understand how any negativity could come from this pillow. No bed bugs, no it wasn't flat (by far the most fluffiest yet firm pillow ever!) and it has been nothing but a blessing! Im 28 weeks pregnant and my hips, ribs and back are constantly in pain.. but after a few nights sleep with my new pillow I get a full 9-10 hours of sleep (not counting the times to go potty), and I could also sit on my couch pain free with it too! My husband wants me to get him one too after taking a nap with it. I didn't even sleep this well when I wasnt pregnant! I'm also 5'8 and the height is a perfect fit for my body! Very, very happy customer and more than satisfied!"
b'I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 88 year old Mother who has severe arthritis.  She has used it every night since Dec. 25 & she said she loves it.  It gives her good neck & head support plus her back.  Since she is a widow & sleeps alone, she tends to get cold.  But this pillow cradles her & keeps her warm also.  She loves it!  She wondered why I was giving her a "pregnancy" pillow!!!  LOL!  She had a good laugh but I explained how I had read that it might help her.  She agrees now!  I highly recommend this for other reasons besides "pregnancy"!  Thank you!'
b'I bought this pillow on 2017 Black Friday weekend, exactly one day after the SALE was over (talk about bad timing?). I was 24 weeks pregnant and I was already uncomfortable every night, although my bump was not so big. I did a lot of pregnancy pillow research before I bought this item and after I read the bad reviews for this product, I was inclined not to purchase it anymore. However, my hubby convinced me to try it and I did it!  I purchased the product on Saturday, regular shipping and I was pleasantly surprised to find it delivered on Monday afternoon. Package looked perfect, easy to open, pillow was brand new, super clean, although I rarely do that with I new purchase, I started using it right away, without even washing the cover. The instructions were simple and clear and I was notified that I have to wait for a while before the pillow goes to its original shape (as it was vacuum sealed). My sleep quality increased tremendously, I would recommend this item to all pregnant women that have trouble sleeping. We own a king size bed and it takes just 50% of it, yes it is bulky and firm, but this is what I was looking for. I am 5\'8-1/2" and fairly "skinny" for a pregnant lady , but I have no complaint about the length and I can tell you my baby is not letting me sleep with my knees as high as the picture shows, he always kicks me and dictates the angle of my thighs. The pillow didn\'t lose its shape 2 months later and I am actually rotating sides each week and I wash the cover every month. The first time we tried to put the cover back it worked like a charm (but I really needed my husband\'s help). The second time I washed it, we were tired and lost our technique so we kind of hassled but not the pillow\'s fault that we weren\'t thinking right at 11 pm. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and I am recommending this pillow to everyone. This is the first time I used a pregnancy pillow and I am not paid for this review.'
b'I\'m not sure why this got some bad reviews. I did a LOT of searching for a pregnancy pillow, and they all come with very mixed reviews. Ultimately after a personal recommendation, I decided on this one. I was worried since the negative reviews specified that it seemed very small and not long enough. I\'m definitely not a small person (plus-sized gal) and I\'m 5\'6", and this works great for me. I am about 4.5 months pregnant and I was starting to get backaches from sleeping, plus I\'m a back sleeper and I kept finding myself on my back through the night.Sleeping with this pillow is like sleeping in a cloud. I thought I\'d hate the filling but it\'s very soft, and not at all lumpy. I don\'t find the neck too high, in fact I put another pillow between my head and this one (granted it\'s a very flat squishy down one). As mentioned, I\'m 5\'6", and while this doesn\'t go all the way to my feet like in the picture, it does hit a little below my knees which is plenty to just keep my hips aligned and to stuff the end of this between my knees.  For those who do want a much bigger one, there does exist a bigger pillow by this same Queen Rose brand, which I\'d have gotten if I didn\'t have a queen-sized bed.  Unfortunately my husband still needs a space :-) This one fits great and he still has plenty of room to sleep.Also, this isn\'t only for pregnant women - my husband loves sleeping in this when I\'m not around, and he said lying in it makes him fall asleep immediately. I only wish I had selected a different color; I only noticed I could get white or gray after I already ordered with the default pink and blue. It\'s a little gaudy. But the cover isn\'t a bad texture at all as some others said - I find it very comfy as is, right out of the package.Oh and it was really fun to open the vacuum-sealed package and watch it spring up into a big fluffy pillow. When it first arrives it definitely looks wilted and flat :)  All in all, great pillow, and totally saving my sleep while pregnant!'
b'I am obsessed! Soon as it came out of the package that kept it flat, it poofed right up. And the grey cover is so soft. You can fluff it up for more support and it\xe2\x80\x99s very versatile. Takes up half the bed so hubby is still fine, maybe just a little jealous lol. He just ends up cuddling the side I\xe2\x80\x99m not using! Recommend this to anyone!'
b"I bought this and the mama bee belly butter combo for my first time expecting wife as a surprise and she lovessss both of them!! She especially loves the body pillow. She says it's so comfortable and helps with knee, back, and neck pain, as well helps her sleep better at night. Definitely recommend for expecting moms and if you're the soon to be dad reading this BUY IT FOR HER SHE'LL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE!!"
b'***updating my review because the seller was fantastic** This pillow wasn\'t for me probably because of my prior spinal and hip problems. The seller offered me the larger version but I just don\'t have space in my bed for it. But they did everything to try to make me happy and ultimately I\'m glad I tried this out. Thanks Queen Rose! I\'d say if you\'re 5\'6" or over get the larger version.I spent forever searching reviews of pregnancy pillows before picking one because I already had back and hip problems prior to pregnancy. This one seemed like a great option in theory but after about a month of use I\'m convinced I don\'t particularly like it. The padding in the pillow is kind of uneven throughout and its incredibly difficult to change positions in it. I wish it was a little longer because I always feel like I\'m tugging it to try to support my legs, and my hip pain has gotten worse if anything since using it, and now I often wake with rib and shoulder pain from the weird position I end up in.  It\'s not a bad pillow. It\'s well constructed, maybe I\'m just not a fan of the u shape style, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for ladies with spinal and hip issues.'
b"This pillow is incredible. I am in my 5th month of pregnancy and even though my tummy isn't huge yet I was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I would toss and turn. My back and hips would hurt throughout the day, I would wake up with headaches, and always be exhausted (and cranky)! This pillow has changed all of that! No joke the first night I slept with this thing I got better sleep than I had in two months. I woke up feeling rested and ready for the day. My back and hips no longer hurt. I didn't wake up nearly as much at night and frankly I am just in a better mood overall because I finally got some sleep! I put off buying this pillow and now I wish I would have had it all the time!"
b'I am over 50 so I am, obviously, not pregnant.  I bought this since I have a hard time getting comfortable and always use 5 or 6 pillows to try to sleep.  This product is so comfortable, that I can finally get some good sleep.  I bought one for my daughter too and she loves it too. It is not just for pregnant people. I also use it to watch TV in bed by crisscrossing the lower parts Good quality.'
b'I am a stomach sleeper so being pregnant is a giant sleeping pain for me. I had to adjust to sleeping on my side but I hate having just a pillow between my knees. I kept getting sciatica in my left hip/butt cheek while sleeping and had to figure something out. I researched a lot of pregnancy pillows and decided on this one 1) because it gives me the ability to rollover and be supported on both sides(I toss alot) and 2) the multiple good reviews. Let me tell you this pillow is worth all 5 stars! It is so comfortable and supports me perfectly while sleeping. I\'ve had it a little over a month and sleep so much better now. I love that I can cuddle it and it\'s not too hot or heavy to keep my arms under. I can push the opposite side behind my back for support and lay facing up a bit comfortably. I can tuck the sides under my legs or butt if I need extra support too - it\'s so amazing! Even my husband loves the pillow and tried to steal it from me after he had ACL surgery and was stuck on the couch. I am definitely going to be using this long after giving birth. Also,  I am 5\'8" and it\'s just about the max length for me to use properly with my legs. It might be a bit less comfy for a taller woman but then again everyone\'s body shape and sleeping positions vary. Don\'t let that discourage you I would still give it a try! I\'m probably going to buy one for my husband and daughter as well because they both love it as much as me lol.'
b"I'm not pregnant.  I'm 68 and I have 6 herniated discs, kyphosis, scoliosis -- serious curves in my spine.  I don't have a medicare doctor with much enthusiasm for helping.  They say use tylenol and heat or ice depending on the talking head so I decided to try a body pillow.  Hard to discern between all the choices, but I picked this one due to reviews and price.  It is nothing short of a miracle.  I am able to sleep lying down on the bed because I don't ever have to let my spine be flat on the bed, I can prop myself up for support.  I can change sides with ease, even sleep partly on my back.  The first night, I slept 10 hours and never moved my position once.  I am so grateful for this relief.  And sleep makes a world of difference healing from this latest bout with a thoracic disk i.e. huge difficulty breathing.  I will never be without it again.  Thanks Queen Rose."
b"Back and neck pain has been 75% better with this. I am 37, 5'11', with arthritis and some deteriorating discs, brand new high end mattress wasn't completely cutting it, this has helped so much!"
b"This pillow is by far the most amazing pillow I have ever used. Of all the products I have bought during my pregnancy to make myself more comfortable, this one takes the cake! I suffer from hormone related insomnia so sleeping has pretty much always been an issue for me, but with this pillow, I am so relaxed and comfortable that I've have been sleeping almost normally. I had a C-shaped body pillow before I found this one and only used it once because of how much I toss and turn at night. With the U-shaped pillow, I can turn over and don't have to worry about trying to flip the pillow with me. I honestly look forward to coming home and laying down now which has never been the case. I would recommend this pillow to anyone and everyone!"
b'I use this pillow for reading at bed before falling asleep. I place the large section behind my head and then place the two \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d next to me or sometimes across my middle to hold the book in place. When I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to sleep, I actually turn the pillow upside down so that my head is on my own pillow while the \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d snuggle against my back and stomach, since I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper. Very comfortable pillow and quite large! We have a Queen sized bed and it takes up my entire half of the bed - with me sandwiched in the middle of the cushions - which is fine with me. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier with it.'
b"I bought this pillow for my pregnant wife after reading tons of reviews on all different types of pillows. She'd been having difficulty sleeping and pain in her back and hips. She started using this pillow and immediately got a better nights sleep. She is 19 weeks pregnant now and has been using it for about 5 weeks. I will say though, we have a queen bed and it takes up more than half the bed. I'm OK with the sacrifice because she sleeps better."
b'This pillow is AMAZING! I had the Leachco Snoogle pillow for my last pregnancy and hated it. The design is terrible and in a \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 shape that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support your belly when the long part is supporting your back. If you flip it and the long part is supporting your belly in the front, then there is a big gap where your back is and you have to put an extra pillow there.Anyway, I was so glad to find something else out there that actually worked and was comfy. The part where you lay your head is also not too fluffy/full (like the Leachco one) and won\xe2\x80\x99t give you a neck ache.I am going to recommend this pillow to all my pregnant friends in the future. :)'
b'I struggle with back pain from a work injury and this pillow helps so much. It can be used with your head on the cross part or by your ankles. I use a temperpedic pillow so I put the top/cross piece between my ankles. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand for my knees or ankles to rub at night. It helps with lower back support and is just plump enough to be comfortable without being too firm or to large to comfortably use without your neck or shoulders sitting at odd angles. My 4 year old stole it to use in her bed because it makes her feel \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d because she won\xe2\x80\x99t roll out of bed. She never has and has rails on her bed but it takes away a fear she has and she likes to snuggle in the i shape. We had to buy another one because she loved it so much too.'
b'I am a stomach sleeper, so pregnancy makes sleeping very difficult for me. I swore after my first pregnancy I would have to do something different as most nights I would end up on the couch after not being able to find a comfortable position. I bought this pillow 10 weeks into my second pregnancy and have slept in my bed every night! (I am now 20 weeks along). I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t like sleeping on my side, but this pillow supports my back and stomach and I like to put it in between my legs. I am able to sleep through the night! It does get a little warm, as the fabric is kind of fuzzy, but it makes such a difference in helping me sleep that it\xe2\x80\x99s not too big a deal to be a little warm. I also had to remove a little of the stuffing as it was too firm for my liking. I would also note that it is very large! I have a king size bed, so my husband still has plenty of room, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much room there would be on a queen. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it, a girl needs her beauty sleep, no? We will have to see how well it helps me sleep as I get bigger, but so far I have no regrets. I would buy this pillow again!'
b'I have had this now for almost 2 weeks and LOVE how comfortable it is. Im currently expecting my first baby and have had trouble finding a comfortable sleeping position as i usually sleep on my stomach. This gives me enough support in my stomach to be able to lean just enough on my side to feel comfortable and like Im not squishing the baby. The only downfall is the cover has already started to rip at the seams. Being as i can sew I am able to fix this pretty easily, but its still annoying to have owned it less than a month and already see damage. I have the grey cover and it is SUPER SOFT so that is a bonus!!'

b"So far, this purchase has been my single greatest move as the husband of a pregnant wife. There are a few particular features that I'd love to discuss:-Jersey cover: my wife LOVES this material. It holds up well, and it seems to only get more comfortable throughout its lifetime. The cover is very easy to pull off and wash. It's slightly more difficult to put back on the pillow -- I'd suggest that it's a two-person job.-Shape: The support this shape gives is seemingly unrivaled. I had purchased a couple of other support-style pillows before this one, but where this one really shines above the others is this: you don't have to maneuver to keep it in place. It's just there. You can elevate your feet, or you can tuck it in between your legs. You can rest on your back, or you can flip to your side (and still have belly support). It's an extremely versatile shape.-Zipper: Minor detail here, but the zipper placement is great. It allows you to flip the pillow without it interfering with your sleep at all.I would highly recommend this product."
b'This pillow has been one of the best purchases of my life.I never sleep without it now. I find my fiance using it all the time. In his words, it is "the best sleeping product ever invented". My animals love it, too. It get some of the best sleep I have ever gotten. Pregnant or not, I think everyone should own this pillow. My only complaint is that it makes getting out of bed to pee three times a night difficult, because I am too comfy to want to get up... but the second I lie back down after emptying my bladder, I am back to peak comfort.I can sleep with it, sit up with it supporting my swollen feet, use it to give my back extra support while reading. It does it all!I can not speak highly enough of this pillow. I WILL WARN, it\'s a bit of a pain in the butt to get into the pillow case at first, just due to the weird shape of the pillow, but it\'s really not a big deal.I can NOT speak higher of this pillow, and I implore everyone to buy one. FORGET body pillows. PREGNANCY PILLOWS WILL RULE THE PILLOW WORLD.'
b'Oh. My. Word. I swear this thing is heaven sent!  I\xe2\x80\x99m actually irritated that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy one when I was pregnant two years ago.  Not only have my nightly leg and foot cramps all but disappeared (I still have them on occasion but not nearly as often nor as intense), but I sleep almost every night like I haven\xe2\x80\x99t in years.  With this pillow I fall asleep and, unless needing a bathroom break, I am OUT.  I often wake up with a sore/stiff shoulder simply because I sleep so well that I don\xe2\x80\x99t budge.I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will stop using this even after I have the baby.Before anyone assumes: I was not given this product in exchange for a review or other compensation.  I just wanted to try it because I was desperate, it had good reviews, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t outrageously expensive. :)'
b"Seriously love this pillow. It it's like a hug and a snuggle without the body heat. It supports all the right places. My husband HATES this pillow with a passion I cannot explain. I keep trying to get him to give it a shot but he hates competing with it for space. I wish I could care that he hates it, but it's the only thing that helps me sleep."
b"Great buy! I am glad I decide to go for it.  I was hesitant because it isn't cheap and people said it is huge, but I am very happy.  I am not small and we have a full bed and this has been fine.  It has really helped me sleep! I am 23 weeks pregnant and the past couple weeks have been more difficult for sleeping.  This pillow has helped me to sleep comfortably on my left side and stay tilted when I'm on my back with my legs up.  I love it! Only complaint would be that it is warm, but nothing other than that.  It is soft and comfy, not too firm.  Love it!"
b'Love it! My husband and I have changed our time measurement to BP (Before Pillow) and AP (After Pillow). I wasn\'t sleeping well BP and would wake up 5-7 times a night, getting out of bed around 4 times for whatever reason. I would toss and turn and talk in my sleep and sometimes kick my poor husband. AP, I still wake up a few times per night (those raging hormones!) but I fall right back to sleep and feel rested in the morning. Aside from that, I don\'t thrash about anymore. I\'m a right-side sleeper, but am training myself to sleep on my left. This pillow makes it so comfy! You can face either direction, and even on your back, the pillow provides just enough tilt so that you\'re not flat on your back (a pregnancy no-no). The gray matches our sheets so it doesn\'t look too ridiculous. I\'m 5\'1" and it works perfectly for me!'
b'I put off getting a pregnancy pillow because I figured shoving some small pillows behind me and under my knees was good enough.  I really wasn\'t sleeping well and I got a gift card to amazon so I decided to purchase this pillow at about 5 months pregnant.  I have significant neck issues where I use an orthopedic pillow and I was worried this may not work for me but it\'s been great!  The first time I curled up in it, I thought- "Where have you been all my life, my good friend?"  It did take about a week for my body to contour the neck area just right and for me to learn how to flip over in the middle of the night in a smooth motion but it has been really wonderful and has helped me sleep much better.  It\'s way easier than having to wake up more to find the pillow that become dislodged and get it sleepily back into place.  A little expensive but definitely worth it.'
b"I absolutely LOVE my c-pillow!!! I got it around week 20 of my pregnancy, and now at 27 weeks, I don't know how I could've gotten by without it. It helps me be so much more comfortable when I'm sleeping than placing a bunch of pillows around my body, and I've even traveled with it. Washing/putting back on the pillowcase was very easy too (it was weird figuring out where to zip it up the first time but now, after seeing it once, it's a snap). It helps me sit up and read when I need to, and works well with other pillows (for when I need to elevate myself for heartburn). It is a little large for a queen-sized bed, but there is still plenty of space and sometimes I wake up and see my hubby's face sleeping on part of the pillow too because it's so comfy (even though he jokingly complains that I'm pushing him out of the bed). Fin: I LOVE THIS PILLOW."
b"A great buy! Very comfy. My favorite part is how it goes between your knees, although now that I'm a little bigger it's harder to switch sides because you have to take your leg out from under, flip over, and put your other leg under. But that comes with the big-belly territory, I guess. I purchased this a couple months ago---I'm currently 6.5months pregnant, and now that my belly is bigger, I like to lean on the long side of the pillow, and it's almost like you're sleeping on your belly (my preferred sleeping position, pre-pregnancy). I have noticed, however, that I have been waking up on my back quite a big with both legs over the end of the pillow--not sure if that has anything to do with the pillow shape or if I just end up stuck that way in my sleep lol."
b"Currently 16 weeks pregnant with twins and I have been using this pillow since around 12 weeks when my belly started popping up.  I'm usually a stomach sleeper so I believe this pillow is the only reason I've gotten any sleep since then.  It was much fluffier than I expected.  I thought I would still want to use a pillow for my head with this, but I have had no problems using this as both my head and body pillow.  We'll see if I still like it when I am the size of a whale, but so far I love it!"
b'This pillow is a pregnancy game-changer. I had been suffering from severe SI pain and sciatica (no amount of stretching was helping). After one night, my pain had lessened and after 3 nights my pain is almost gone. It takes a while to get used to sleeping with it but it\xe2\x80\x99s soooo worth it. I do find if I sleep towards the opening of the C, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough support for my large belly. That being said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to use this than the 4-5 other pillows I had that weren\xe2\x80\x99t working. My husband also prefers this in our bed over the pillow fort I had before. I have always had bad neck problems and used a memory foam therapeutic pillow for years, but I find this does the job well and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up with neck or shoulder pain. Best purchase ever, I wish I had bought it sooner!!!'
b'I was skeptical of buying a pillow for this price specifically because of pregnancy but after almost 2 weeks not being able to sleep well and being in pain at night due to hip pain, back pain, and sciatic nerve pain due to being pregnant, I finally gave in and bought this pillow. Every pregnant woman out there please listen to me: if you love yourself buy this pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s been exactly 24 hours and my life is changed. Also if you have a toddler who likes to sleep with you still don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that. My 18 month old fits perfectly with me with the huge pillow perfectly and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the comfort at all. Only negative thing I have to say is it\xe2\x80\x99s a magnet to husbands. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get him one too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 24 weeks and just starting to feel uncomfortable (lower back pain, random aches, etc) so I decided to do a little research and I selected this pillow based on reviews and recommendations. Best decision ever! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never slept better! Also, when I\xe2\x80\x99m just lounging, watching TV or reading, I fold the pillow in half and use it as back support. My husband calls it my \xe2\x80\x9cpillow fortress\xe2\x80\x9d so I made him try it today... We are now ordering another one for him! He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how comfortable it was! I highly recommend this product, even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not pregnant. (Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of a germaphobe, so I love that it comes with a washable, super soft jersey knit cover!)'
b"It's not the biggest or best pillow out there, but it's been a lifesaver and you can't beat the price. If you have excess cash, buy a more premium one, but if you are budget couscous like me, this is well worth the money. Don't think I could sleep at all without it-- pregnancy is harder than I expected!"
b"I'm expecting multiples after 2 other children and finally caved and bought one of these pregnancy pillows. I should have bought one years ago!!!! I always sleep on my stomach and have a terrible time sleeping any other way. I am now a side sleeper as this pillow makes a cozy little nest and keeps me from turning. I never wake up with an aching neck or shoulders. It's glorious. Buy one now. It does take up about half of my queen bed but my husband hasn't complained."
b'Photo is the pillow on a twin mattress. It perhaps may look a little weird in the photo but you can manipulate the shape to your liking.I should first say that I am not pregnant but the hilarious pregnant reviewers who swore by this thing for all of mankind persuaded me that I needed it and they were RIGHT. this thing is amazing. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a rosebud. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a big hug but not in a claustrophobic-awful way, but like you\xe2\x80\x99re just supported all over. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. You can manipulate it to get more or less support in various places or change the places on your body you want support and still put a pillow underneath the head part to keep high elevation if you need it. Also the whole outside zips off like a pillowcase which you can wash. Also I want to marry this. You need this.'
b'I got this pillow after one of my friends told me it was a lifersaver during her pregnancy. It helps a lot, specially if you are a back sleeper and have to switch to being a side sleeper. I was able to angle myself so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on my back, but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely on my side. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to being on my side and the pillow helps me to stay that way.  It\xe2\x80\x99s great to have it between your knees when you are on your side. The pillow is soft and comfortable. Often times, I find my husbands knees on the pillow also!! He agrees it\xe2\x80\x99s very comfortable. The pillowcase is very soft.  I would recommend this pillow.'
b"Very good quality, easy to remove cover, very comfortable.  I did not notice a smell and did not have any issues with the pillow puffing up and filling out after opening.  When received it is compressed into a blanket roll type bundle, slide the heavy plastic off and the pillow opens to it's full size and fluffs up.  Great packaging, no oversize awkward boxes.  Only wish I could find an allergan cover that protects it from moisture, like I use on my regular pillows.  I'll contact the company directly for suggestions."
b'When I first got it I was disappointed because it was not nearly as stuffed as I had anticipated.HOWEVER- the first night I slept with it I woke up 7 hours later in the exact same spot I fell asleep which is unheard of for me at 8 months pregnant.  Well worth the money but I was very upset that it did not count towards my baby bucks rewards.'
b"I ordered a pregnancy pillow for myself when I was in my first trimester. I initially hated it because I'm a stomach sleeper but the further along I got into my pregnancy the more I fell in love with it. Fast forward to after baby's arrival: my sister came to stay with me to help with the baby for a while after I went back to work. She used the pillow and loved it. I told her she could have it but my grandma somehow ended up stealing it from her lol \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 so I ordered her a new one in her favorite color, pink. She absolutely loves it and has to fight her boyfriend for it sometimes! I'll definitely be ordering another pillow for baby #2!"

b'Wow. I\'m a guy so I don\'t know anything about being pregnant, but what I do know about is being comfortable and Bluestone knocks it right out of the park with this product.Stuffed with the dreams of small children and sewn together with strands from the beard of Zeus, this product raised the bar for what I look for in slumber comfort. It\'s unique U shape swaddles your body in a way that I can only describe as being hugged by a gentle giant as he rocks you to sleep at night whispering, "Rest now, little one. I\'ll protect you."Not quite ready to sleep yet and want to spend some time sitting up on your phone? Fold the arms of the pillow up behind you and you have what are 3 support pillows, essentially reminding you "Hey, we\'ve got your back, literally and figuratively."When I woke up after my first night using this product I immediately asked my boss if I could take 5-7 days off of work because that\'s the amount of time I wanted to spend, one on one, with this pillow. He declined, and I can only assume it\'s because he has never known the glory of this level of comfort.Don\'t be thrown off by the name and assume only pregnant women can benefit from this fantastic product. That\'s an extremely small demographic and perhaps Bluestone should reconsider their marketing tactics.You spend 2/3 of your life in bed. Don\'t you think you deserve to go to sleep AND wake up with a smile on your face?'
b'I bought this because I have fibromyalogia. I have trouble sitting on the couch for too long. This pillow is wonderful. It allows me to sit in the living room for much longer.  Also, I am a side sleeper and this really helps with pain on my hip. I have wanted to buy one of this for a long time and am very happy with the packaging, delivery and quality of the product.'
b'Absolute must have for pregnant ladies, or anyone really! I am 5 months pregnant and this pillow allowed me to sleep comfortably for the first time in a while. It\'s not to thick, not too thin. If you want a really thick and firm version of this pillow you should check out leachco "back and belly" pillow. This pillow gave me the perfect amount of support without being too firm. The pillow case it comes in isn\'t super soft (but it\'s not bad) so I changed it out with one I bought from the leachco brand (the jersey fabric one) and it fit. I did also wash the original case and it softened up. I would highly recommend this pillow. To me, anything more firm would give me a neck ache in the morning.Update: I\'ve been using this pillow for quite some time now and it\'s held up perfect. It hasn\'t lost its shape or become defective in any way. This is one of five maternity/body "u" shape pillows I have purchased and it\'s still my absolute favorite. All the others I\'ve purchased, like I said, are too firm and give me a neck ache in the morning.'
b'I\'ve been using this pillow for the last 385 days and I LOVE it. After being in a relationship for 13 years (All my adult life), when I finally moved out on my own, I was worried I wouldn\'t be able to sleep alone. This pillow really helped me deal with being alone in bed, and giving me the comforting feeling I was going to be missing.  I sleep in a weird position, and HATE having my thighs touch when I sleep. This is perfect because it lifts my leg and hips, allows me to easily put 1 arm over and under and squeeze it.  You can use the "leg" near your back to prop yourself up. It\'s light weight, but it is still fluffy. The cover is a little difficult to get back on, but TOTALLY worth it for all the benefits I\'ve gotten. Not gonna lie, I\'m with someone new, and, some nights, I still choose to cuddle my pillow over him #sorrynotsorry'
b"I'm not prone to hyperbole, but this pillow saved my life.Okay, that is a hyperbole, but it has been a metaphorical life saver. Starting in my first trimester, I was struggling to get comfortable because I typically sleep on my stomach. Each time I would go to lay on my sides, I would either naturally turn to my stomach (a habit I was trying to break before 20 weeks) or my back would hurt after a few hours. Even with smaller pillows between my legs, it did not help.I bought this pillow and it changed everything. It took a few days to get used to and it really does only allow you to sleep on your sides, but it is so comfortable. I actually feel supported throughout the night and I find it cozy that it sort of encloses me. It limits or totally eliminates any back pain, even on nights where I'm sleeping for 10 hours (pregnancy is tough!).The sole downside is really for my husband and not for me. This thing is BIG. We have a queen size bed and it takes up maybe 60%? Maybe even a little more? I try to keep it compact, but it really is a large pillow. That being said, from my perspective, it's a home run, and my husband seems willing to take the loss because I am definitely less grumpy when I sleep enough!Plus, my dog loves it too. She sleeps all over it before I get into bed, but she know, when Mom comes in, she's got to leave the pillow!"
b"I've had this pillow for a couple of days now and I absolutely love it. First of all, I am not pregnant lol but I wanted one of these pillows because I have a bad back and wake up every morning in so much pain. I need the extra support this pillow offers. At first I thought I would be disappointed since it was flatter than I thought it would be. Surprisingly however, it does provide some vert comfortable support in just the right places. I got a memory foam mattress the same day as the pillow and I havent slept so soundly or pain free in years!"
b'I am not pregnant whatsoever, but I have a side sleeper and I like to prop my knee up while I sleep. This pillow gives so much support in my lower back and legs, and it really makes me feel comfortable lounging and watching  TV. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT - will update with more information if needed'
b"I ordered the C shaped one the first time, and I did not like it at all. It was too full, too hard, too hot, and just plain uncomfortable. This one is perfect. It's flexible, but not flimsy. It's perfect for laying my 7 months pregnant belly on, and getting the support I need. It's not hot, it's not hard, and it's not too full. Even my husband snuggled up to one side of it. My son is already asking for me to order one for him too, which I will be doing soon. I would absolutely recommend this product."
b"I'm pretty sure this got me at least 42 bonus points with my pregnant wife. This definitely made sleeping with her new add-on much easier from weeks 24-39.  She told me multiple times this was one of the best things ever invented. She is still using it as it helps support and position correctly for nursing.  Full disclosure, we have a King bed and any bed smaller than a Queen would probably be difficult to fit two people and this pillow, but your mileage may vary. If in doubt, get this for your pregnant wife and hopefully get some bonus points too. Don't worry, it's just a pillow, doesn't mean she doesn't love you anymore."
b"Best thing I bought during my pregnancy! It provides great back support while still letting me out something in between my legs. It's better then using a lot of regular pillows because those keep moving and are hard to get placed where you want them. This is one giant pillow that is perfect around my body all night long. I am a few most post partum now and I use it to prop me up in bed to feed my baby. So it works after the baby is born too."
b"My husband wants one now. Came vacuum packed and fluffed up quickly. I sleep so comfortably! --after having this for a couple months and being further into my pregnancy, I must say this thing is a life saver! I can't sleep without it. The cover washes nicely and even though it does get flat after some weeks of use, throwing it in the dryer with tennis balls fluffs it back up. The case material does make me hot during the night, but I also usually have atleast two animals in bed with me. The cats love it too!"
b"I have purchased now 3 different 'pregnancy' pillows and this one by far is the best one I have ever had! Game changer! And It came in very quick! The removable pillow case is also a huge plus! :) I found that generic body pillows are too think, and the other pillow I got from BabiesRUs was super expensive and didn't last but almost 2 months. This full body maternity pillow feels like a nice down pillow, and can be used for breast feeding if that is something you are thinking about trying! I am in love with this pillow and sleep so well! This pillow wold run $80-$100 in the store, so get this pillow!!"
b'THE MOST COMFORTABLE pillow I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever slept with. Wish I had this when I was pregnant! I bought it for surgery and also bought the slip cover (made by different retailer) - saved my life for the week after surgery. This thing is HUGE. Soft and fluffy but really keeps its shape, especially when in the slip cover. Arrived in a small box because it came vacuumed. It\xe2\x80\x99s also pretty affordable if you look at other body pillows. 100% recommended!'
b'Bought this thinking it might come in handy every once in a while. Now I sleep with it every night and it is a saving grace! I love that it not only supports the tummy really well, but supports my back as well. Be aware that it is very large, so if your bed is not a king, your partner might not love it as much as you. We have a queen sized bed, and my husband complains that it takes up more of his space than he would like.'
b"I rarely, if ever write product reviews as a personal rule. This pillow has compelled me to write a review. I am not pregnant so I can't answer any questions in regards to that aspect of the pillow. But i do suffer from horrible neck issues and no pillow has yet worked to relieve my neck pain. I have tried cooling pillows, bamboo pillows, feather pillows, and none of them worked. This body pillow works. I noticed in two days that my neck felt great. I'm also sleeping throughout the night without waking up constantly. This pillow works. The only complaint I have is how bulky it is and doesn't much the decor of my bedroom. That's the only complaint, that's it. Get this pillow and you'll start feeling better asap!"
b'I bought this for my 6 month pregnant wife and she would always have problems @ night to sleep cause of her back or the baby was not Comfortable but wow with this pillow let me tell u she now does complain no more @ night and she feels better well she can rest now really happy with this pillow..for the price its really worth it..i give it a two thumps up\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b'I bought this around month 3 or 4 and am now month 8. I cannot imagine how I would have slept without it.Especially since after 20 weeks, it is not recommended to sleep on your back, and I was a back sleeper; this helps you stay on your side comfortably.'
b"This pillow is a DREAM!  It fits me just as the model pictured - enough space for it to go between my legs, a little spot to go under  my bump when I got large enough for that as a need, and I can sleep on it alone without other pillows.  Sometimes I like to put one of my regular pillows on top for more head elevation (when I'm stuffy etc.)  It is SO NICE to not have to move the whole pillow around when I want to switch sides.  You just roll over and have the same thing on the opposite side! (When I used just a regular pillow between my knees and would need to roll over in the middle of the night, it would always get caught on the covers and be a pain.  Not with this pillow!)  I would definitely buy it again."
b'Wife love this thing.  The wife is 22 weeks pregnant so this thing is great for her to find that magical position for her to sleep with.  The pets seem to love it too so we have to hide it when not being used!  Came in a vacuum sealed pack so it looked super tiny.  Wife is 5\'.2" and its maybe a little longer than her.'
b"I would have given more stars but this thing is HUGE.I Mean I think its a bit too big.Maybe it's just me? I can hardly fit it on my bed.It is comfy but I was expecting a boppy pillow type thing lol. If you want a x-large body pillow you will not be disappointed. I Bought it for back/hip pain, it does relieve the pressure and ease the pain .They were not cheap with fabric and stuffing.I wish it would have come with a cover like others do."

b"I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant and a side sleeper. Since I'm getting closer to my 2nd trimester I've been trying not to sleep on my back and for the past week my hips have been killing me. I have always slept with a pillow between my  knees but it still didmt seem to help. I asked fellow pregnant ladies what has helped and they all said stretching and one of these pillows. I got mine yesterday (a day early) and was so excited. I'm not really a fan of the cover as it wasn't as soft as I was hoping and it was kinda stiff so I just took it off. I was kinda worried because of want as fluffy as I thought it would be but I moved some of the fluff around in the arms and gave it a go. I slept SO good last night and had no hip pain whats so ever!! I'm so happy with this pillow, I was worried about room as well as me and my husband only have a queen but he wasn't suquished and even liked to rest his arm on it. He laid in it for a little and even said I might have to get him one ha ha. Thank you so much, you have made me one happy mama!"
b'The best purchase I have made. This pillow is a great size and is so amazingly comfortable. I use it for my back pain amd it is great. It is hard to pay on and not fall asleep right away. I am very pleased.'
b'I got this pillow very early in pregnancy because I am a stomach sleeper. It made is so comfortable to sleep on my sides as the shoulder support is there as well as the ability to have one side support your back and the other between your legs. I also had a back injury while being pregnant and it took over a month to recover. This pillow was a life saver for me. Yes it\xe2\x80\x99s big and bulky, I wish the cover was a little better quality or had another layer so the fluff wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so easily exposed. But I have to say I\xe2\x80\x99m my research and the likes this pillow is the best! You can also use it for proving yourself up and reading and the like!'
b'This pillow is amazing and I would do commercials for free.  I am not pregnant but I do have issues getting a good night sleep due to back pain and fibromyalgia.  I have tried everything to relieve the weight of the pain and sometimes it is all a discouraging quest, But I am really excited about this product and highly recommend it to my fellow sufferers.  I have slept so much better and happier.  I have slept through the night.  Amazing.  This pillow cradles you and fills in all the curves so you are totally supported.  Even if I just wanna read a book in bed, it is so comfortable.  I sleep on my stomach, which they say is not good, but now I sleep much more comfortably.  My neck is not stiff when I wake up.  Wow.  Sleep is so important and so elusive when you are hurting so much. This pillow is the best thing I have purchased in a long time.  It is so comforting to wrap around it and find the perfect fit for a cozy and comforting true rest.  I could not be happier.'
b'Love it! Exactly what I was hoping for. Nice and sturdy'
b'I read a lot of complaints about this product but quite frankly, I love it. There are variances in thickness rippling across the pillow but it follows the curves of the pillow and works great if you lay on it as intended. I bought the pillow early on because I have back problems to begin with and I found out I am pregnant. While I do not know how it will feel when I am further along, it is already a great investment for my back alone. My husband is not the biggest fan because it tends to eat up some of his bed space (whoops!), but I\'ve even caught him using the side a couple of times in his sleep. Overall, very comfy and great shape. It is maneuverable and bendy so I can fold each arm to a position I want and it always does what I need it to. My only "complaint" is that the center of the headrest part is not very thick so I placed my current pillow under that part and it\'s perfect, but I like my head elevated a little more so that could be personal preference. Overall, great pillow! I bought it on sale during a lighting sale for a fraction of the cost but I would definitely be willing to pay full price if I ever need another one! More than worth it. I am sure I will be using this long after my pregnancy is over. If you want to save a few bucks though, keep an eye out for Amazon\'s lighting deals and see if it maybe it pops back up.'
b"Best thing ever! I'm now 19 weeks pregnant and this pillow saved my sleep life. I have already recommended it to everyone. Arrived on time, nice packaging and has not torn or ripped; I've had it for 3 weeks now."
b'Nice size and plush. Was exactly what I was expecting'
b"I'm not pregnant, but recent had foot/ankle surgery. This was very helpful (and WAY comfortable) in helping me sit up/ prop up my foot when needed. I'm actually planning to keep using it to read in bed. Very cozy and snuggle. My little dog wants to snuggle on it, too. LOL"
b'6mo pregnant and having to adjust to the terrible side sleep position has been hard for me {I\xe2\x80\x99m a stomach sleeper}. With the pregnancy pillow I have slept all week at night without waking up. It\xe2\x80\x99s been marvelous!!!!'
b'One of the best purchases I have ever made! Has helped me sleep so much better. I would definately recommend to anyone who is expecting.'
b'I love the pillow! My husband even tries to steal it from me because it\xe2\x80\x99s so comfortable! It is both squishy and firm and totally supportive. It helps keep me on my left side so I can sleep comfortably. I have brought it camping, to my mom\xe2\x80\x99s house when I have stayed there, and to hotels. I will probably use it after pregnancy as well! Love it!!!'
b'Looking forward to many nights of slumber cuddled up in my pillow.'
b'This thing is a lifesaver for those who have a hard time getting comfortable!'
b'I was sceptical with this pillow but wanted to give it a shot....it was a MIRACLE WORKER. i had trouble sleeping every night!. Now i sleep like a baby! I only get up for those midnight pee breaks...NOTHING ELSE\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a male with years of back pain, especially when sleeping.  I was skeptical when my physical therapist suggested I try a pregnancy pillow. Since I\xe2\x80\x99ve had your pillow I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to finally get sleep, almost completely pain free. I would have never believed it, but now I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep without this pillow. The only thing that could be improved is the inner stitch seam which is rather stiff and sometimes rubs me wrong. But all else good.'
b'I was pleasantly surprised by the softness of this pillow! It really helped me throughout my pregnancy, very comfortable. For individuals that need thicker head pillows, I would recommend to use and extra pillow for their head and neck. The only thing that bothered me was the pillow case, not soft at all, and washing it a couple of times did not help. But there are some cheap and good covers out there, so be sure to buy some if you buy this pregnancy pillow.'
b"Best pillow I've bought so far very comforyable"
b'I was very skeptical because the price is so low. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat it!'
b'Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I order sooner? This pillow has been a game changer for me! I sleep so much better now!'

b"First, this is a fantastic product. When my wife hit about 20 weeks pregnant she could no longer stand not being able to sleep at night and the daily exhaustion was becoming overwhelming. She is a stomach sleeper and once her belly became more prominent, she was no longer able to find a comfortable position for sleeping which in turn didn't help me much for sleeping through the night either. We began researching alternative means and came across the Cozy Bump. The reviews looked great and we figured it was worth a shot.When the Cozy Bump arrived, we made sure to use a air compressor to completely inflate it per the instructions to make it as comfortable as possible. The second my wife laid across the Cozy Bump, she knew it was going to be perfect. Finally she could lay on her stomach while simultaneously relieving the pressure in her lower back thanks to the unique design of the product. Not only has my wife been able to sleep through the night, this product is also great for naps! Something everyone, especially pregnant women, certainly love.Unfortunately, three days ago my wife was taking her usual nap on the Cozy Bump and when she rolled over one of the seams busted causing a hole to tear, ruining the product. It was very upsetting but with anything that blows up by holding air over long periods of time, this can happen. I checked the Cozy Bump website to see their policy on exchanges in the event of something like this happening. I was extremely pleased to see that an exchange policy does exist and there was a way to direct message the company. What happened next may have been the best customer service I have ever received.Within hours of explaining what happened, I  received an email stating that as long as I gave them the order number and person's name they would ship a replacement, no questions asked. I offered to ship the old one back or send pictures but it was not necessary. Logan and Kathleen's biggest concern is making sure the customer is satisfied and that they get a good product. My hat is off to them for being so prompt with their responses and not trying to fight me on an exchange. The Cozy Bump really is a great product and their customer service is second to none."
b'Truly we were pretty skeptical. We\xe2\x80\x99re expecting TWINS and she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tall and nothings been work. I bought it with her being unsure and she\xe2\x80\x99s been on it since I put it together. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend this for sure. There seems to be only one size and my wife is 5\xe2\x80\x997\xe2\x80\x9d/5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d and is covering it pretty well (For anyone who needs a reference). Hope it works for you too! Got it when she was 19 weeks.'
b'The cozy bump is exactly what I anticipated and exactly what my back needed. I am 32 weeks pregnant and after blowing it up, I laid down on it and exclaimed to my husband "ahhhh instant back relief!" It stretched it out in a way that no fitness ball or anything else has been able to. I had a couple concerns when ordering that were put to rest:1) did I really need to purchase the pump? My air mattress pump worked just fine. If you don\'t have something like that laying around, then yes you would need it.2) would my boobs be squished and in pain? My ordinarily 34C boobs have grown to 36DD in my pregnancy and I was fine, it didn\'t give me any comfort issues.3) is it worth the $70 with shipping and everything? Honestly, yes. I had read another review that said if you got a pregnancy massage it would be more and that\'s all it took for me to hit \'order\'.My only concern upon receiving is the print out that comes along with the product. There are so many typos on that bright, glossy print-out that it really made me question my confidence in the product. Just a word of advice to the business: have someone proofread before printing probably thousands of copies that you are sending to people who have just paid you good money for a good product! Nothing makes you look more unprofessional than poor grammar and ridiculous typos.'
b"I think this is a great option for those who want back relief while pregnant, or are regular stomach sleepers. It was relatively easy to fill with the help of my bike pump and boyfriend, and I liked that you could adjust the air in the upper ring that sits near your hips.Unfortunately, I have also been experiencing horrible rib and back pain since being about 32 weeks pregnant, and laying on my stomach made it much worse despite having no pressure on the belly with this pillow.I think if you're having regular pregnancy aches and pains, this is an affordable and great option! My situation just happens to be worse. I debated keeping it to take camping or use in the future post pregnancy, but decided the refund made more sense with a baby on the way.I contacted the seller about returning it, and they replied quickly and seemed understanding of my situation. So 5 extra stars to the seller for that. ;)"
b"After months of Sleepless nights, my wife purchased the CozyBumb and finally had a decent nights rest. The separate inflation for the hole ring is a blessing as she can adjust it to her liking. She has been having a lot of troubles with her hips and going to massage therapy and using the cozy bump there as well so she doesn't have to lay on her side and the therapist has even raved about it. Our only complaint is that only after a couple of months the Cozy bump did start to deflate quickly, however customer service is amazing."
b'My wife loves it! It helps her sleep at night. She said at first it felt weird, but after a few minutes she felt comfortable.  Also its easier for me to give her a full back massage while she is on it.'
b"Bought this as a gift for my little sis. She is having her first baby and she loves this thing. She says that she can't wait to get home and lay on it."
b'I purchased the Cozy Bump for my wife after she complained about back pain during her pregnancy.  We inflated it the night that we got it and my wife loved it from the first time she laid on it!  The Cozy Bump has been a life saver in helping her with her back pain!'
b"I never knew how badly I needed to lie on my stomach from time to time during pregnancy. First of all, when you're big as a house and can't get comfortable anywhere, this is great to throw into the rotation. When I lie in it I instantly feel the weight move off of my hips, the blanket supports my belly in the little hammock it makes, and my back feels like it realigns. Secondly, getting a proper, lying down back rub during pregnancy is just heaven. This is my third pregnancy and I'm mad I didn't know about this the last 2 times. I don't use it very often (because it's huge and I have to keep storing it and dragging it out again) but for those days that my hips or lower back are just plain dying, this really does the trick.Minor complaints which I don't feel warrant removing stars:- It deflates quickly. Not quickly enough to be a problem while you're lying on it, but you definitely have to top it up before you get on it another day,which is kind of a nuisance.- Since there's no particular space for your head, they know you need a pillow. That combined with needing space for sore pregnant chesticles makes me wonder why it doesn't slope down at the top like it does at the bottom. My chest and neck getting sore is the reason i get up eventually when I'm lying in this otherwise blissful state.- The main body inflates with a pump, but you have to inflate the extra cushion donut around your belly by mouth, which is gross since you're obviously going to end up selling or giving it away when you're done with it."
b'When it was delivered i was surprised how light it was. It was fast delivery. It was a gift for my sister in laws massage business. She loves it.'
b"Of all the various products on the market to make pregnancy more comfortable and bearable, I am convinced that this one makes the biggest difference!I am a stomach sleeper by nature and have been tortured, like so many women, losing sleep night after night turning from one side to the other- either of which compresses your hips eventually- or trying to rest on my back, which puts the full weight of the pregnancy on your organs & spine! You *really* need quality rest when you're pregnant but it can feel impossible to get when you're used to sleeping in a way you no longer can! I remember how wonderful it was to sleep well again on my stomach immediately after my first was born. But now, you don't have to wait until then!Not until I discovered the Cozy Bump did I find sweet relief for this age-old problem. It realigned my aching back and makes me feel SO much better after a long day chasing my other two little ones around. Well-worth the price for the comfort and relief it provides instantly.I also love how quickly it inflates and deflates to store easily in the handy provided bag. I was able to pack it up quickly, bring it across country to my in-laws and enjoy a nice movie night with them in total comfort instead of constantly readjusting.I honestly feel this product has made me a better mother to my other children during this pregnancy- when I'm rested, I'm so much more patient and able to respond to their needs. My only regret is not knowing about this wonderful product for both of my other pregnancies.Don't get a pregnant friend more onesies or diapers- get her a Cozy Bump!!! And if you're pregnant yourself or recently found out your partner is- don't hesitate- get it! You definitely will not regret it when the belly gets huge, hips and back are aching and heartburn hits- it helps so much with the discomfort of all 3!"
b"This is by far the best purchase I've ever made. HIGHLY recommend. I for the first time in months have gotten a full nights sleep. I put it right on my bed. I put a pillow at the front so that I have enough arm space with my pillow I sleep on. The first couple of nights I got about 3hrs of sleep. I thought that was a miracle BUT I got 7 hrs of sleep last night. Omgosh I feel like a new person. I didnt get up to pee one time. Its probably because laying on your stomach prevents the baby from sitting on your bladder. I've never wrote a long review but I cant say enough about this product. Even if you have 2 months left in pregnancy like I do it's worth it to get some sleep. The quality and price is perfect."
b"I am 20 weeks and 2 days pregnant. I have been experiencing a lot of pressure and tightness in my belly. I had been using a regular inner tube before this and it does not compare. I am so happy with my purchase of the Cozy Bump.It is so comfortable. It is as if you're laying on an air mattress tailored to the human body shape but also include a hole for your growing belly. I am so comfortable on this I cant even relate to you the comfort and joy I feel while laying in/on it. Also, I have to dogs both over 65lbs. They have both stepped on it and it's very durable. I am not saying, go outside and use this on your lawn or something crazy. I just want to inform you, if you test your products limits, it won't disappoint."
b"after reading other reviews on this i just had to try it, and it is worth every penny.  i am 5'6 and was 116 lbs before getting pregnant and 156 lbs at 38 weeks pregnant.  my belly was able to fit in the hole just fine, however I'm not sure if i would want the top end longer or shorter.  i am not a belly sleeper so i can only lay on it for about 15 minutes before my neck starts hurting from it being turned to the side.  so either shorter for my head to hang off the edge, or longer to be able to put a head hole in it (which might not work for someone taller or shorter).  I'm not sure what the best modification would be but either way, the pillow does its job and really helped keep my back pain down between chiropractic appointments.  i even took this on vacation with us, and boy was i glad i did!  after all of the walking during the day it was a fabulous relief at the end of the night.  it was also nice because my husband was able to give me massages at home more comfortably, which i loved.  i will also say that at 38 weeks my belly was starting to touch the floor, so i started putting it on the bed when i used it just so that it would be extra soft.  it didn't touch enough to be uncomfortable or hurt.  my belly right now is almost 43 inches around."
b"I am 7 months pregnant with my third child (leaving this review from my husband's account though, hehe), and I can't believe it took me this long to discover this product. I used to use my pillows to create an insert for my tummy, but soon this hack wasn't effective as I just got too big and the pillows sunk in. So, I found this product and ordered it immediately. I got it within one day (one day shipping was not that bad at all and totally worth it), and immediately when I tested it out, my back pain was 100 percent relieved. I was able to take the best nap I've had in quite some time, and I know I will be using this on the regular. Worth trying out, for sure!"
b'Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Fellas if you want brownie points buy this, because when my wife lays on this it is like instant back relief. She can lay on her stomach without hurting the baby or herself.  Great for massages trust ur wife or babies mother will pay you to massage her back on this. Runs the length of a king size bed with about 6 inches to spare from headboard to footboard.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend using in the floor unless person has help getting up off of it.  If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave it blown up leaning on the wall buy an air mattress pump that inflated and deflates by battery will deflate in no time.  Glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy a inflatable inner tube although that\xe2\x80\x99s an alternative my wife likes that she stretch her whole body out.  Product improvement add a whole for the breasts.'
b"My wife loved this. She said it was one of my best buys. She didn't even have a problem with me going fishing after that. The baby is just 2 weeks away and she still uses it. I got it a couple months ago"
b'Love the concept but it hurt my belly. I would write a review with less stars because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use it but the company is being AMAZING about me returning it. So no money is lost for me and I got to try it in hopes of getting more sleep!'
b'My husband bought this for me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I would like it but I actually love it! So comfortable! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been the type to sleep or lay on my stomach but when you are far along in the pregnancy and can\xe2\x80\x99t lay on back or stomach everything seems so uncomfortable. This helps bring a little comfort back!'
b"I'm pregnant for the 5th time in 10 years and during EVERY pregnancy, I've always wished there was a way to sleep on my stomach. I'm so glad I finally gave in and bought this mattress. My back feels so amazing while laying on it. It also feels great during the day since I've had the chance to let it stretch out/relax at night! Thank you so much for creating this product, I should've bought it when I was pregnant with the twins last year!!"

b'This Pillow has universal uses in my household. It could quickly turn into a comfy circle-liked pillow that my 9 month-old daughter could lie on it while watching her favorite kid channel on TV (see first photo). The U shape provides extra support on her neck. It also made sleep much more tolerable for my wife who really needs support for her back and her legs at the same time. Often times, I also use it along the wall to prevent my little one from bumping her head against the wall. Overall, this purchase was well worth all the pennies!!!Please press the Helpful button under this review so I know someone reads it.When I shop on Amazon I rely heavily on other people\xe2\x80\x99s honest reviews to help me make the right choice on what to buy and what not to buy. So, in turn, I always make sure to leave my HONEST opinions on products that I review. It is my motto that I try to give as much detail as I can right after I experience the product. If you have any questions for me on something I failed to mention, please ask and I will respond quickly. Please be assured the product has earned the rating I have given.Have a nice day!'
b"So far, this purchase has been my single greatest move as the husband of a pregnant wife. There are a few particular features that I'd love to discuss:-Jersey cover: my wife LOVES this material. It holds up well, and it seems to only get more comfortable throughout its lifetime. The cover is very easy to pull off and wash. It's slightly more difficult to put back on the pillow -- I'd suggest that it's a two-person job.-Shape: The support this shape gives is seemingly unrivaled. I had purchased a couple of other support-style pillows before this one, but where this one really shines above the others is this: you don't have to maneuver to keep it in place. It's just there. You can elevate your feet, or you can tuck it in between your legs. You can rest on your back, or you can flip to your side (and still have belly support). It's an extremely versatile shape.-Zipper: Minor detail here, but the zipper placement is great. It allows you to flip the pillow without it interfering with your sleep at all.I would highly recommend this product."
b'This pillow has been one of the best purchases of my life.I never sleep without it now. I find my fiance using it all the time. In his words, it is "the best sleeping product ever invented". My animals love it, too. It get some of the best sleep I have ever gotten. Pregnant or not, I think everyone should own this pillow. My only complaint is that it makes getting out of bed to pee three times a night difficult, because I am too comfy to want to get up... but the second I lie back down after emptying my bladder, I am back to peak comfort.I can sleep with it, sit up with it supporting my swollen feet, use it to give my back extra support while reading. It does it all!I can not speak highly enough of this pillow. I WILL WARN, it\'s a bit of a pain in the butt to get into the pillow case at first, just due to the weird shape of the pillow, but it\'s really not a big deal.I can NOT speak higher of this pillow, and I implore everyone to buy one. FORGET body pillows. PREGNANCY PILLOWS WILL RULE THE PILLOW WORLD.'
b'Okay so I am not pregnant but I heard these pillows are great. I figured I would try it out and if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it I would give it to my sister who is pregnant. Well needless to say she isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting it. I love it!! If you\xe2\x80\x99re a side sleeper like me its great it allows me to tuck in between my knee and also hug the top part. My sleep has got so much better. All I can say is it\xe2\x80\x99s not just for pregnant women its great for everyone.'
b'Oh. My. Word. I swear this thing is heaven sent!  I\xe2\x80\x99m actually irritated that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy one when I was pregnant two years ago.  Not only have my nightly leg and foot cramps all but disappeared (I still have them on occasion but not nearly as often nor as intense), but I sleep almost every night like I haven\xe2\x80\x99t in years.  With this pillow I fall asleep and, unless needing a bathroom break, I am OUT.  I often wake up with a sore/stiff shoulder simply because I sleep so well that I don\xe2\x80\x99t budge.I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will stop using this even after I have the baby.Before anyone assumes: I was not given this product in exchange for a review or other compensation.  I just wanted to try it because I was desperate, it had good reviews, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t outrageously expensive. :)'
b"Seriously love this pillow. It it's like a hug and a snuggle without the body heat. It supports all the right places. My husband HATES this pillow with a passion I cannot explain. I keep trying to get him to give it a shot but he hates competing with it for space. I wish I could care that he hates it, but it's the only thing that helps me sleep."
b"Great buy! I am glad I decide to go for it.  I was hesitant because it isn't cheap and people said it is huge, but I am very happy.  I am not small and we have a full bed and this has been fine.  It has really helped me sleep! I am 23 weeks pregnant and the past couple weeks have been more difficult for sleeping.  This pillow has helped me to sleep comfortably on my left side and stay tilted when I'm on my back with my legs up.  I love it! Only complaint would be that it is warm, but nothing other than that.  It is soft and comfy, not too firm.  Love it!"
b'Love it! My husband and I have changed our time measurement to BP (Before Pillow) and AP (After Pillow). I wasn\'t sleeping well BP and would wake up 5-7 times a night, getting out of bed around 4 times for whatever reason. I would toss and turn and talk in my sleep and sometimes kick my poor husband. AP, I still wake up a few times per night (those raging hormones!) but I fall right back to sleep and feel rested in the morning. Aside from that, I don\'t thrash about anymore. I\'m a right-side sleeper, but am training myself to sleep on my left. This pillow makes it so comfy! You can face either direction, and even on your back, the pillow provides just enough tilt so that you\'re not flat on your back (a pregnancy no-no). The gray matches our sheets so it doesn\'t look too ridiculous. I\'m 5\'1" and it works perfectly for me!'
b'I put off getting a pregnancy pillow because I figured shoving some small pillows behind me and under my knees was good enough.  I really wasn\'t sleeping well and I got a gift card to amazon so I decided to purchase this pillow at about 5 months pregnant.  I have significant neck issues where I use an orthopedic pillow and I was worried this may not work for me but it\'s been great!  The first time I curled up in it, I thought- "Where have you been all my life, my good friend?"  It did take about a week for my body to contour the neck area just right and for me to learn how to flip over in the middle of the night in a smooth motion but it has been really wonderful and has helped me sleep much better.  It\'s way easier than having to wake up more to find the pillow that become dislodged and get it sleepily back into place.  A little expensive but definitely worth it.'
b"I absolutely LOVE my c-pillow!!! I got it around week 20 of my pregnancy, and now at 27 weeks, I don't know how I could've gotten by without it. It helps me be so much more comfortable when I'm sleeping than placing a bunch of pillows around my body, and I've even traveled with it. Washing/putting back on the pillowcase was very easy too (it was weird figuring out where to zip it up the first time but now, after seeing it once, it's a snap). It helps me sit up and read when I need to, and works well with other pillows (for when I need to elevate myself for heartburn). It is a little large for a queen-sized bed, but there is still plenty of space and sometimes I wake up and see my hubby's face sleeping on part of the pillow too because it's so comfy (even though he jokingly complains that I'm pushing him out of the bed). Fin: I LOVE THIS PILLOW."
b'This pillow is a pregnancy game-changer. I had been suffering from severe SI pain and sciatica (no amount of stretching was helping). After one night, my pain had lessened and after 3 nights my pain is almost gone. It takes a while to get used to sleeping with it but it\xe2\x80\x99s soooo worth it. I do find if I sleep towards the opening of the C, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough support for my large belly. That being said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to use this than the 4-5 other pillows I had that weren\xe2\x80\x99t working. My husband also prefers this in our bed over the pillow fort I had before. I have always had bad neck problems and used a memory foam therapeutic pillow for years, but I find this does the job well and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up with neck or shoulder pain. Best purchase ever, I wish I had bought it sooner!!!'
b'I was skeptical of buying a pillow for this price specifically because of pregnancy but after almost 2 weeks not being able to sleep well and being in pain at night due to hip pain, back pain, and sciatic nerve pain due to being pregnant, I finally gave in and bought this pillow. Every pregnant woman out there please listen to me: if you love yourself buy this pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s been exactly 24 hours and my life is changed. Also if you have a toddler who likes to sleep with you still don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that. My 18 month old fits perfectly with me with the huge pillow perfectly and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the comfort at all. Only negative thing I have to say is it\xe2\x80\x99s a magnet to husbands. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get him one too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 24 weeks and just starting to feel uncomfortable (lower back pain, random aches, etc) so I decided to do a little research and I selected this pillow based on reviews and recommendations. Best decision ever! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never slept better! Also, when I\xe2\x80\x99m just lounging, watching TV or reading, I fold the pillow in half and use it as back support. My husband calls it my \xe2\x80\x9cpillow fortress\xe2\x80\x9d so I made him try it today... We are now ordering another one for him! He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how comfortable it was! I highly recommend this product, even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not pregnant. (Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit of a germaphobe, so I love that it comes with a washable, super soft jersey knit cover!)'
b"It's not the biggest or best pillow out there, but it's been a lifesaver and you can't beat the price. If you have excess cash, buy a more premium one, but if you are budget couscous like me, this is well worth the money. Don't think I could sleep at all without it-- pregnancy is harder than I expected!"
b"I'm expecting multiples after 2 other children and finally caved and bought one of these pregnancy pillows. I should have bought one years ago!!!! I always sleep on my stomach and have a terrible time sleeping any other way. I am now a side sleeper as this pillow makes a cozy little nest and keeps me from turning. I never wake up with an aching neck or shoulders. It's glorious. Buy one now. It does take up about half of my queen bed but my husband hasn't complained."
b'Photo is the pillow on a twin mattress. It perhaps may look a little weird in the photo but you can manipulate the shape to your liking.I should first say that I am not pregnant but the hilarious pregnant reviewers who swore by this thing for all of mankind persuaded me that I needed it and they were RIGHT. this thing is amazing. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a rosebud. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a big hug but not in a claustrophobic-awful way, but like you\xe2\x80\x99re just supported all over. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. You can manipulate it to get more or less support in various places or change the places on your body you want support and still put a pillow underneath the head part to keep high elevation if you need it. Also the whole outside zips off like a pillowcase which you can wash. Also I want to marry this. You need this.'
b'I got this pillow after one of my friends told me it was a lifersaver during her pregnancy. It helps a lot, specially if you are a back sleeper and have to switch to being a side sleeper. I was able to angle myself so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on my back, but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely on my side. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to being on my side and the pillow helps me to stay that way.  It\xe2\x80\x99s great to have it between your knees when you are on your side. The pillow is soft and comfortable. Often times, I find my husbands knees on the pillow also!! He agrees it\xe2\x80\x99s very comfortable. The pillowcase is very soft.  I would recommend this pillow.'
b"Very good quality, easy to remove cover, very comfortable.  I did not notice a smell and did not have any issues with the pillow puffing up and filling out after opening.  When received it is compressed into a blanket roll type bundle, slide the heavy plastic off and the pillow opens to it's full size and fluffs up.  Great packaging, no oversize awkward boxes.  Only wish I could find an allergan cover that protects it from moisture, like I use on my regular pillows.  I'll contact the company directly for suggestions."
b'When I first got it I was disappointed because it was not nearly as stuffed as I had anticipated.HOWEVER- the first night I slept with it I woke up 7 hours later in the exact same spot I fell asleep which is unheard of for me at 8 months pregnant.  Well worth the money but I was very upset that it did not count towards my baby bucks rewards.'
b"I ordered a pregnancy pillow for myself when I was in my first trimester. I initially hated it because I'm a stomach sleeper but the further along I got into my pregnancy the more I fell in love with it. Fast forward to after baby's arrival: my sister came to stay with me to help with the baby for a while after I went back to work. She used the pillow and loved it. I told her she could have it but my grandma somehow ended up stealing it from her lol \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 so I ordered her a new one in her favorite color, pink. She absolutely loves it and has to fight her boyfriend for it sometimes! I'll definitely be ordering another pillow for baby #2!"

b'I am not pregnant. I deal with fibro and RA pain in my shoulder blade.1. It came squished, but fluffed very quickly. I actually took a nap with it about an hour after and it was so comfy and then later it fluffed more!2. That nap - OMGosh! The best sleep I have gotten in years! I suffer fibromyalgia and do not take pain medication. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable and sleep is key, but it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible. Not with this baby!!!3. It is giant, but oddly not. We have a queen bed and my partner is a big sleeper. This pillow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt her takeover. She is able to spread out and I am able to still sleep comfortable. We I am cuddled in it we (the pillow and I) still take less space than a twin size bed.4. At this price I figure if it stays fluffy for five or six months I am happy. We spend money on so many things these days - sleep is def worth the investment. If I do have to replace I will update and let you know when. (I will also convert the old pillow to a dog bed because my big dogs are obsessed.)'
b"First of all I am not pregnant... I have been told I need hip replacement surgery, knee replacement surgery and have had neck surgery and back surgery but due to a car wreck I've been advised additional surgery would be necessary. Anyhow my nights are very long, sleepless and painful. I have found God's Word is helping more than anything regarding healing but as I'm learning how to receive my healing... this pillow is absolutely AMAZING!!! I can move it into a million different positions to relieve pain and also restless leg syndrome. I love that the outer cover is removable so I can wash it. Also the cover is great quality it's thick...almost as thick as a sweatshirt."
b'I have shoulder and back problems from lifting a 95 lbs disabled person all day. I have tried muscle relaxers, physical therapy, and was talking about injections with my doctor. I decided to procrastinate and get this pillow to see if it would properly support me while I sleep so everything could relax and repair while I slept. I\'m so glad I did! I got made fun of for buying a "pregnancy pillow" but it was able to keep my shoulders at the proper position AND let me tuck the "arms" behind my knees to help my back (side note I am 5\'2) . This pillow (in addition to meds and physical therapy) has ceased the need for the injections. Even if you aren\'t pregnant, this is a GREAT support pillow! It\'s firm enough to keep its shape but squishy enough that it\'s soft and perfectly cuddly.'
b"Hi. I'm 14 weeks pregnant with my third baby. Have a new amazing tempurpedic cool technology mattress (which I normally sleep great on) and two $200 pillows. I though this pregnancy I will sleep like a baby! Nope! Along with my bump showing up earlier so did all my aches and pains and bedtime restlessness. His pillow didn't have too many reviews but I wanted the grey jersey fabric cover. I swear no matter what my position on this thing I feel great. I sleep better and my butt got smaller (just kidding). When I read I put another pillow under the head part and it's so comfy. I'm actually terrified that something will happen to it and came back here to think about ordering a backup just incase. Oh and it's not too huge like some of the other ones I was looking at. It's great all around."
b"I cannot say enough good things about this body pillow. Once I hit 3.5 months pregnant, I was having major trouble falling asleep. I have a broken back that, combined with the usual aches and pains of pregnancy, made it nearly impossible for me to find a comfortable sleeping position. It would seriously take me 3-4 hours to fall asleep at night. I ordered this body pillow, and every night I've fallen asleep within 3-5 minutes of getting in bed. The firmness is enough that it supports my back and neck no matter which position I choose to sleep in, and I'm finally able to fall asleep quickly and sleep through the night. I also love that it comes with a cover that makes it easy to wash, because I swear I can smell EVERYTHING these days so I always need everything to be super clean. I would highly recommend this body pillow to anyone with back pains or pregnancy insomnia!"
b"I have been using this pillow for almost 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with it.  At 12 weeks pregnant, I already felt uncomfortable sleeping on my back (I have really low blood pressure) and switched to side sleeping.  I tried putting a pillow between my knees but that only helped a bit so I decided to look into getting a pregnancy pillow early (I love my sleep).  I am amazed at how much this pillow help me... having one side to lean against with my back or one side with my stomach allow me to make small adjustments (like straightening my legs out more or one completely out plus shifting the weight from just one point on my hip to more on my butt or thighs) that seem to make all the difference in my sleep quality.  When I was doing the one pillow between my leg thing, I would wake up 4 times a night to shift or would wake up on my back, this pillow solves all of that.  I still wake up once to pee, but that just comes with the territory.Also of importance, this pillow was clean and odorless as soon as I pulled it out of it's packaging... no chemical/factory smell.  The pillow case is nice and soft.  And I was worried that I wouldn't like the head support since I'm slightly picky when it comes to pillow, but it is perfectly comfortable so I had zero trouble adjusting.  This is all upside, ladies, so treat yourself and get this pillow sooner than later!"
b"I'm 25 weeks pregnant and really enjoying this pillow! I'm normally a back/stomach sleeper so I've been really struggling to sleep comfortably on my side. I first purchased the Snoogle after a friend recommended it. I wanted to love it, it was great quality. But I could not get past the shape. My head wasn't comfortable and I didn't like having to flip it over in the middle of the night if I changed sides. THIS however, is like a hug all night long! I can change sides comfortably without struggling to flip the pillow. I would probably rate quality itself as a 4- it's not bad, but doesn't feel quite as high quality as the Snoogle. However, it is comfortable and I am sleeping far better with this! It makes it easier to fall and stay asleep, so 5 stars from this pregnant lady!! Highly recommend.Update: I am now 35 weeks pregnant and am more thankful for this pillow than ever. It's the only reason that I sleep at all these days. Best purchase I've made in a long time (which is saying a lot because I've bought a lot here lately!!)."
b'I don\'t know what possessed me to buy this pillow, I saw it and thought "wow that looks comfy"! I was right, it is comfy and I absolutely love it. I am WAY past the child bearing age so I recommend it to anyone male or female who wants a good nights sleep. It\'s snugly and comfortable and so far has kept it loft and shape. My 15 year old grandson loves to lay on my bed and watch TV while laying inside it. Last night my 7 year old granddaughter spent the night and wanted to sleep with it. She loved it so much that she asked me to get one for her in pink. You can still move around and change sides without difficulty. I use it and one bed pillow under my head without any stiff neck what\'s so ever.'
b"Update:I used this pillow after my hips started to bother me very early on in my pregnancy.I don't think you need to be pregnant to use this. Actually I wish I would have used it years ago.But it definitely worked for my hip discomfort. And as I am about to give birth soon, I can say it works wonderfully in the third trimester. Zero regrets for getting this product. A definite must have in pregnancy.The company does not use flame retardants or chemicals in their pillows. This is something few people think about. You should. Especially when you start buying baby products (clothes especially polyester is a problem, car seat, bassinets, crib mattress, etc) because of the scientific data that details the negative health effects of these chemicals in our babies. Do your research. For adults mattresses and pillows are where we get exposed to flame retardants the most.Anyways, I contacted the company directly and they send me this:Thank you  for your reply. None of our pillows use flame retardants and/or chemicals, you could use it with confidence.Please contact us anytime if you have any questions.Have a nice day!Best regards,AngQiOriginal Review:I have been using this for a bit. I have to say this has made a huge difference in the quality of my sleep. I am able to find a comfortable position easily and at some point you have to sleep sideways when you're preggo and this helps with that! My hips also don't hurt as much while sleeping. But I have preggo induced hip soreness so no pillow or gadget will fix that. However, this pillow is amazing! Even my significant other tries to steal it from me. Good luck to him >=)."
b"Very, very pleased with this pregnancy pillow!  I had purchased a different U-shaped pillow late in my last pregnancy that I loved (wish I had ordered sooner!), but it didn't come with a removable/washable cover.  These pillows take up a lot of space, so I got rid of it shortly after I stoped nursing.  As soon as I found I was expecting again, I placed my order for this pillow.  So glad I did!  I purchased the 55 inch U-shaped full body with the jersey knit cotton cover.  Package came vacuum sealed and the pillow popped right up upon opening.  It's a very full pillow (which I absolutely love) and gives great back support.  I removed the cover that was easy to replace back on after being washed and dried.  I'm petite at 5' and the 55 inch size fits me just right.  Love the light, soft jersey cover and grey color.  Highly recommend!"
b'I myself am not pregnant but am a side sleeper. I find myself able to get comfortable faster as opposed to tossing and turning to find that restful position. My boyfriend enjoys it as well and I find him somehow "ending up in it." I\'m 5\'2" him 5\'5". I feel like it\'s a great length whereas you can adjust the arms into multiple positions with ease . Poofy, firm, dense, and comfortable!! Quality hasn\'t failed. I like all the accessibility you get with removable cover and ability to adjust filling to your liking. I\'m glad I chose this brand after shopping around. I\'ve bought two more for my sister\'s.'
b'I am 6mon pregnant and was unable to sleep well at night. Tried to use an extra pillow to help support my belly but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work that well. My belly is not big comparing to most of the moms, but I felt gassy and my back hurts occasionally. I feel extremely satisfied after using this pillow - it feels like .... sleeping on the cloud. I temoved all other pillows in my bed, put my head on the U shaped area and snuggle with the legs. So comfy!The only thing I feel a bit awkward is to put the pillow back to the pillow case after I washed the case. The legs are bulky and it takes some time to squeeze them in the case.'
b"After reading all the reviews for all the U-shaped body pillow I jumped out the window and bought this one and DEFINITELY made the right decision. It's not too bulky doesn't take up all the space in our queen size bed. Definitely has volume, if it flattens out I will update my review."
b'Expecting mommas, I received my angel pregnancy pillow yesterday and let me tell you, I slept so good last night! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been sleeping more than a few hours in a night due to RLS, bad dreams, or just constant tossing and turning. This pillow is able to support your belly, which I had issues with using just a regular pillow. But I woke up this morning feeling good, bed still partially made and doggy on the bed.(he\xe2\x80\x99s been sleeping on the floor with my constant flipping and turning.) I would HIGHLY recommend one if your having issues sleeping. I got mine off amazon, but they are in stores too! Hopefully this helps another soon to be zombie momma like myself.'
b"I'm a massage therapist and I purchased this for use with my prenatal clients. I use it conjunction with a wedge pillow. My clients refer to it as the cocoon, or sometimes the moat. I tested out my own set up and let me tell you, it's super cozy! It provides just enough back support and neck support, and let's you flip easily from side to side without having to drag a full body pillow with you. The cover is a full cotton jersey with a nice stretch, and replacements are available so I can have multiple covers and use one while the other is soiled. So far, the oil I use has only done minimal staining."
b"This pillow saved me! I was not sleeping AT ALL. Tossing, turning couldn't get comfortable. I am not pregnant, I just needed additional support for my back which this provides and has helped ease hip and leg aches. It also keeps me in one spot so I don't wake myself up constantly moving around, but allows me to easily maneuver if I need too and I fall right back to sleep. My dogs love it too. I will often find them snuggled up in the middle of it under the blanket. Have no issue with the fluff. I throw it in the dryer every other time I wash the cover and flip it over often sleeping on both sides."
b'You need one of these! This is seriously The Best purchase I have made for pregnancy. I am on my fourth pregnancy and wished I would have gotten this sooner. It makes sleeping so much more comfortable. I love that it has side support, and back support.  My legs haven\'t gotten charlie horses since they are popped up a bit. I have had it for a few month now and a 30 weeks.  Sleep is getting tougher, but I can\'t imagine getting much without this pillow!I am excited to try it out later with nursing.Cover comes off, so easy to wash. Comfortabl3 and good length for my 5\'11" frame'
b'This is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on or with....that includes my husband (sorry babe).  I am not pregnant but I do have chronic pain in my right shoulder from the way I contort myself at night.  The flexibility of this pillow provides cozy support like you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe and just from the time I have spent snuggled up tonight, napping and reading; I can already feel a difference. I feel like I will need to start bringing a separate suitcase for it on my business trips!  Tonight will be my first full night sleeping on it, so I will report in more as an update.  Oh and P.s.  it\xe2\x80\x99s BIG!!  We have a king size bed so it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.  But it def takes up the space of a flexible, squishy person.  Be aware of that.'
b"Why did I wait so long to buy this?!?! I tossed and turned all night long for several months during my pregnancy and finally bought it when I was 6 months along. I still have to roll over and get readjusted a few times during the night but it has helped me so much. I didn't like the use it like the picture shows. I like my pillow so I use it upside down (like a U) and it works great. My husband is also happy I'm not moving so much at night and waking him up in the process! I was afraid it would take over our queen sized bed but it really doesn't. My husband has plenty of room on his side still."
b"I bought this for my wife that is 9 weeks pregnant and was really struggling to get comfortable enough to really get some rest. I bought this pillow for her birthday and she has commented how comfortable it is and how she has slept more now with it because she can get comfortable and get some sleep. I read the reviews and she hasn't commented that it goes flat at all. I did open the vacuum bag it came in and let the pillow expand but about an hour after I opened the packaging I washed and dried the pillow. It was very fluffy and full after I did so. I would recommend buying this pillow to help you sleep"

b'This is truly wonderful! I\xe2\x80\x99m 6 months pregnant and have had a hard time sleeping through the night. I tried to stay away from purchasing a pregnancy pillow (was using a multiple pillows to prop myself up) but I hit a low and needed some rest, badly! And I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I finally purchased this! Best sleep I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in months! We have a King sized bed, so the area space it takes up is not a concern for my husband and I. Most reviews said to let it fluff for 24-48 hours, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait when it was delivered. So I manually fluffed (as you would any pillow) and I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I love that the cover is easily removalable and washable. Just wish I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought it sooner!'
b"Oh my gosh. What would I do without this pillow?? I was pretty skeptical about maternity pillows, but I have slept so great since using it. I was waking up throughout the night with a ton of hip and butt pain before, but now I only wake up to pee or roll over.PROS: I love the upside down U shape as opposed to the C shaped pillows or body pillows because then you don't need to worry about bringing the pillow with you when you flip over in the middle of the night.  You can also wedge one side under your butt and back while you sleep on your side and have the other part of the pillow between your knees. It zips too so it's easier to wash.CONS: Even though it's sufficient as is, I was kind of expecting the pillow to be more full and fluffy. It definitely does the trick though.  I also wish there were other colors available other than sterile white. Kinda looks like it belongs in a hotel or hospital. Even just a tannish color would be nice."
b'This is the best Ortho pillow ever. I am 69 years old with several joint replacements and this pillow is the answer for comfortable sleep. Thank You'
b'Awesome. I unzipped the one side almost immediately and used only the smaller side earlier in my pregnancy, and now sleep using both halves, just not zipped together. Really has helped me sleep to be practically enswathed in pillows! Note: It does take up a large part of the bed, but it is worth it for comfort. I have taken to just leaving it beneath the covers when I get up (although it sometimes still startles me because it looks like someone is under the covers, because the pillow is so big!)'
b"Ever since I got this pillow all my wife's complaints ceased. I am not sure how much she likes it, but it surely does the job for her. From the first night we got, she was able to sleep without complications or discomfort. I would, therefore, recommend this product to any pregnant woman. The pillow is very soft and comfortable as well."
b'I have never slept better!! The extra width on the knee and feet area allows me free moment to get comfortable.  The easy detectable side is great when I need a quick escape. My bursitis disappeared in less than 2 weeks but I love the snuggle feeling so much I am continuing use.'
b"My daughter had been complaining that she was having trouble sleeping and we had bought regular king size pillows but that didn't help. She wanted to get a pregnancy pillow, after making several trips to Walmart, we couldn't find it in the store. So I took it upon myself and searched on Amazon. I bought it for her and she loves it. We are satisfied with the product, the cost and the service through Amazon.com"
b'I have never been pregnant. I bought this because i am a stomach sleeper but with the damage to my back, I needed something to help me transition to side or back sleeping. I have had this over a year now and I have became a side sleeper which has helped my back pain a lot. Cant breath on my back thanks to my chest but hey, made it to my side! Down fall, hard to clean, and once you wear in the pillow, there is no plumping it back up. You also get used to having it then sleep like crap without it. Otherwise, absolutely fantastic! Now if I can just find a freaking cover to replace the one on it, I would be ecstatic!'
b"I sleep with this every night. Has significantly helped my sciatic problems. It used to be hard to get out of bed in the mornings, and I don't have a problem now. (Although it drives my husband crazy, because it takes up half the bed. LOL.)"
b"I bought this because I'm a side sleeper and always ended up waking rolled up in my sheets and pillows! This is perfect for me, so comfortable, no matter way you toss and turn. I am no issues with the firmness, I think it's just right. Great price point too."

b"When you are pregnant a comfortable night of sleep is nearly impossible. The peeing, the heart burn the leg cramps. It's not fun. I bought myself this pillow just hoping it would help elevate some of the sleep issues I have been having. The pillow makes it easier to relieve pressure from my belly and also my hips and back. I get extra support and the top is high enough it elevates me and helps make heart burn bearable. I was worried over time the pillow would get too soft and loose support but it has held up nicely. Very large and comfortable this is exactly what I needed. Only down side my husband thinks he has been replaced."
b'so comfie!! this has really helped me get comfortable in bed. started using around 3 months into my pregnancy, i am now about 7 months and wouldnt be able to sleep with out it. also nice for when you want to sit up in bed, the pillow is long enough you can flip part behind you for extra cushion and tuck the other part under your legs for extra support. only downfall i have noticed is the zipper is starting to detatch from where the head pillow zip attatches to the long portion of the pillow. nothing a little sewing cant find but still, would be nice if it were a little more durable. but overall very happy with this pillow. Im 5\'9" and it comes down to my knees.'
b"This pillow was so comfortable!  It helped me sleep during my pregnancy.  I have a queen size bed, and the full pillow didn't allow much space for my husband... he adapted, but after about a week I took off part of the pillow leaving just the L shape.It also helped me sleep because I didn't want to be touched during a lot of my pregnancy and it provided a barrier so that my husband couldn't snuggle up and keep me awake, ha!comfortable and easy to clean,  the cover comes off for washing."
b'I use this and I am not pregnant. :)  This is a very comfy pillow I must say.  Since I have many health problems with legs, back etc... I do not need a lot of pillows in order to prop myself up with.  Also, I sleep much better with this anymore along with my c pap machine. :)  Thank you so much for selling this product.'
b"Ever since I got this pillow all my wife's complaints ceased. I am not sure how much she likes it, but it surely does the job for her. From the first night we got, she was able to sleep without complications or discomfort. I would, therefore, recommend this product to any pregnant woman. The pillow is very soft and comfortable as well."
b"What a great purchase just think about it guys instead of having your wife hanging all over you while you're sleeping you can replace yourself with this pillow ONLY KIDDIING. I bought it for my mother she had a stroke and is now handicapped. This pillow has given mom a good night sleep again I highly recommend it great price too"
b'I have never slept better!! The extra width on the knee and feet area allows me free moment to get comfortable.  The easy detectable side is great when I need a quick escape. My bursitis disappeared in less than 2 weeks but I love the snuggle feeling so much I am continuing use.'
b"Pregnant or not I haven't slept this comfortable in years!! One night was enough for me to make my judgement; it's comfy, roomy, incredible materials and build quality. I can comfortably say that it exceeded my expectations and a product this good is worth much more in-store or online. This morning I have already shared my experience with multiple people at work! Thank you so much for an amazing product!"

b'I am not pregnant but have been having a lot of back pain during the night and when I woke up in the morning. This is more on the expensive side for a pillow but well worth it considering the quality and comfort it provides. It is also comfortable in the seated position and provides a lot of support.'
b'Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly impressed! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this for one month so far! I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 19 weeks pregnant. The further along I get the more this helps me! My back gets sore during the day, so does my hips, calves, and feet. I also am experiencing round ligament pain on and off. This pillow really helps me sleep at night. It helps relieve round ligament pain. I find if I flip on my left side with the side pillow in between my legs it relieves the pain. This has also helped my back, hips, calves, and feet significantly. I contort this pillow ALL kinds of ways. It is very flexible! My back would get so sore laying on a flat surface, that made sleeping a nightmare, but this pillow has helped me greatly! It also helps with neck pain I usually get from other pillows. I use it for lounging and sleeping! I use it ALL the time and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone flat at all! It\xe2\x80\x99s versatility is wonderful! I can sleep in any position I please, besides on stomach...gotta protect the baby! I read other reviews that made me nervous to buy, but trust me, it works! It helps! At least for me! As for a size reference I am 5 foot 5 inches tall. I currently weigh 146 pounds, and it is working great for me!!! I love it! I used to sleep with a pile of pillows, now it\xe2\x80\x99s just the one! Hubs loves to cuddle up to the side of this thing too while I use it! I catch his head on it during the night! What can I say? I like this thing a ton! The only annoyance I have with it is the cleaning. In order to wash you have to remove the case and that looks like an honest pain, that\xe2\x80\x99s just because of how the pillow is shaped, it\xe2\x80\x99s an awkward thing to put a case on and off of. I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t mind to much though, I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m getting comfortable sleep for once! I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll use this after giving birth too!!!'
b'I bought for my pregnant sister. She said she bought 5 pillow, this one is the best. It support her very well so she can sleep more comfortable at night. I tried my self. Even I am not pregnant, but it is really nice for me. My back always feel muscle pain, I tried it as a cussion it feels so nice, i think I will buy one for myself as well.'
b'BEST PURCHASE OF MY LIFE! I have terrible, awful sleep, but this made a difference. (It didn\xe2\x80\x99t cure my sleep issues, but it sure improved my sleep substantially) This has improved my sleep quality immensly! Im not pregnant, so this pillow is for everyone. I usually toss and turn all night, but thr first night I slept with this pillow I laid down in position and woke up in the exact position. My husband said I didnt move at all through the night, (he\xe2\x80\x99s up pretty late). I woke up feeling like I actually slept for once.I freaking LOVE that I can fold it in all these different positions to sit up, sleep on my back but raised when my nose is stuffed up, be able to roll over without adjusting my pillow, but my favorite part is while I lay on one arm of the pillow my husband uses the other arm of it!I was worried the pillow would take up to much space on our bed, but even when my husband isnt using the other arm he has plenty of space on his side. I mean jf anything, he has more space because I\xe2\x80\x99m not invading his side.The only negative, is the frustration of getting the case back on because of the odd shape. And not really frustrating more like silly because I suck a putting the fitted sheet on the bed too.'
b"I love this pillow so much that bought another one 2 weeks later for the vacation home. I have pains (neck, arm, hip) due to sleeping on my stomach and purchased this pillow to help me sleep on my side and eventually sleep more on my back. At first the top of the pillow was too high for me, but I read to remove some stuffing if needed. Instead I pushed some of the stuffing into the 'legs' of the pillow and now it is perfect for me. Now I rarely have body pains from sleeping. I highly recommend it. And, again, you can always adjust the pillow to your needs by unzipping the top and removing or moving the stuffing around."
b"I bought 2 of these pillows, 1 for my mom and 1 for me. I bought this when I started having trouble sleeping because of my pregnancy and now that I'm further in, I have no idea what I did without it! This pillow is incredibly supportive in all of the right places and ensures supreme comfort. I was skeptical because I'm 6'2 but it still fits me perfectly! My mom has had multiple back surgeries and back problems over the year but this pillow has provided her with some of the best sleep of her life! Regardless of why you need it, this pillow will help!"
b"I'm now seven months pregnant with my second child and I've had this pillow for about two months... I have to say that this is one of the best purchases I've ever made regarding my pregnancy! I was miserable sleeping before with my first baby, using tons of pillows, constantly having to resituate them and just being plain uncomfortable. This pillow is amazing! It gives support in all the right places and it's nice not having to move a million pillows to get comfortable. Even if I roll onto my back while sleeping, the other side still props me up slightly to the side, it's great. I highly recommend this pillow to any mama!"
b"I had a body pillow through pregnancy that was juts one of those long, straight ones. I would start off at night sleeping on top of it and wake up with it between my knees, but with an aching back. When it was time to replace it, I looked for one of this shape, and it's perfect. It's flat enough that it doesn't get in the way, but still goes between my knees and supports my back (my hips tend to ache if I sleep right on them, another problem this pillow solves). Sometimes I sleep with another pillow under my head, sometimes I just use this. Be warned that if you want something fluffy, this isn't it. It's been fairly compressed since I got it, but that's exactly what I need."
b"Love love love this pillow! Since getting it, I have had the best sleep I've had in years! My bones ache if they connect, so I've always needed a pillow between my knees and ankles.  Then I would wake up to move those pillows every time I needed to turn over.  This  pillow eliminated both the need for the separate pillows AND I don't have to wake up when I turn over.  I only wish I had discovered it sooner!"
b"I have not had the pillow long.  Also, I am not pregnant.  However I have lower back pain.  Since using this pillow.  I have slept very well.  I sleep a lot longer and wake with way less pain if any than before.  I love the pillow.  I can not speak to it's durability because I have not had it long.  However, just from the few nights sleep I have had so far.  I would purchase it again.  Because of it, I am a better person in the morning.  If you ask my kids.  That is saying a lot.  lol"
b'I can\'t believe I was second-guessing making this purchase. I started having trouble sleeping when I got into my second trimester and began looking at pregnancy pillows, but got to thinking that I should try to make do with two regular Serta pillows, one on each side. I finally caved and made the purchase. My husband removed the packaging and let it start to plump before I got home, and I had to almost wrestle it away from him. He said I couldn\'t try it yet, because I wouldn\'t get out of bed again. It\'s been two weeks now and I just wish I had bought it sooner! It gives me all-around support: neck, belly, back, and leg. It\'s long enough to put between my knees ( I\'m 5\' 4") and to kinda curl up around the "legs" of the pillow.It\'s also the perfect width for our queen size bed; my husband still has plenty of room. Plus, I used to hog the bed, and the pillow prevents me from moving! My pillow even came with a twenty percent off coupon from the manufacturer, and my husband said he would take a second for himself!I highly recommend this product!'
b"I bought this a week before having abdominal surgery. I had a lower body lift after losing a large amount of weight and I knew I'd need good support during my recovery. I absolutely LOVE this body pillow! I slept like a baby the first night I used it. I have never slept with more than a pillow under my head but this pillow changed that, it's that comfortable. If you have any doubts at all, put them aside and buy this amazing pillow!"
b'I was skeptical about buying a \xe2\x80\x9cpregnancy pillow\xe2\x80\x9d of any kind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend the money for something I would only use a few months. BUT I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep in about 3 months and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer. So glad I took the plunge with this pillow! I got it Friday and this weekend I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten more sleep than I think I have in the last month alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s super comfortable and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up the whole entire bed so my husband has at least a little room too. :) It\xe2\x80\x99s just the right amount of firmness and not to high so my neck doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt in the mornings. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found a position yet that\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable so if you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to get comfy at night, this pillow is a must have!'
b'Around 16 weeks I was restless , I had so much pressure in my back it was unreal. That pressure only worsened as I grew , so I\xe2\x80\x99m now 23 weeks and decided to buy a pregnancy pillow. I almost bought the one from target until I had seen a picture showing how flat it was, I read the reviews for this one and decided to try it out, I bought the all blue pillow and the cover on it was actually comfortable. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t left it inflate much as I was incredibly eager to try it out , but right away I loved the way it made my back feel. I had errands to run so I guess it inflated more while I was gone , when I laid with it the second time it was amazing. It\xe2\x80\x99s very full, and worth every bit of the money , I haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept this well in a while! ( Also my husband who has back problems  from a surgery LOVED it because of the pressure relief.  Choose this pillow ladies!'
b"I LOVE this pillow.  It took a night to get used to it.  It feels different than my last pillow, but once I gave it a chance I was glad!  I am a larger lady and it still fits me in it.. the sides easily move in and out if needed.  The pillow case is a bit tricky to get on, but it's not that hard... just takes time and two people is easier."
b"This was a dream come true for my pregnant daughter. She was so uncomfortable at night until this pillow came. She was in heaven. She was able to sleep better at night without interruption. The added advantage is that she still uses it now for her and the baby wether to breastfeed or to prop him up. It's worth the money.  It did come a day later as promised with prime, but the item itself is good."
b"I LOVE this pillow! Its so big first of all. Secondly it comes pressed but once you take it out it expands and you fluff it up it works wonders. I don't sleep with any other pillow but this one. I can switch from the left to the right side. My kitten loves this pillow he sleeps with me on it! I haven't washed it yet but I am soon. But so far excellent I recommend it! By the way I ain't pregnant I just needed a pillow that was more comfy and for the full body. So even if you not pregnant get it!!!!"
b'This pillow has been amazing throughout my pregnancy! I love to snuggle but end up getting too hot when snuggled with hubby or with our pups so the pillow is the perfect solution. It is the perfect firmness for me but there is also an option to unzip and remove some padding if needed. I bought an extra pillow case for it to use if the other one needs to be washed. I toss from side to side throughout the night and the U-shape makes it easy to just turn and switch my legs over to the other side. I would highly recommend for anyone pregnant or not!'
b"My mom got me this pillow around 20 weeks pregnant. I'm currently 39 weeks pregnant and let me say this pillow has been a LIFE SAVER!! I love it. I still sleep at least 75% of the night and I give credit to this pillow. I would recommend this pillow to any pregnant woman or anyone have trouble sleeping due to lack of support. It is a rather big pillow, but I have a king size bed so it wasn't an issue for me. The only thing that's kind of annoying is getting the pillow case on and off for washing, but hey that's a pretty minor issue for the benefits of this pillow. Overall Definitely deserves 5 stars."
b'I bought this using my husband\'s account. I love this pillow. I bought it for back support during my pregnancy and also to keep me from rolling over on my back. I am 5\'5" and it reaches my knees when I have my head on it and lie flat. It does offer good back support. This pillow is firm which I love. I have been looking for a firm pillow for a long time. All the ones you get at the store that say extra firm, etc., are a joke. I never thought a pregnancy pillow would be the answer. So if you like soft pillows, you probably won\'t like this pillow. It will definitely see me through my pregnancy and I am very happy with my purchase.'

b'At 6 months pregnant, I was starting to wake up constantly throughout the night from every little thing: a sound outside, my husband breathing in my face, never feeling comfortable, etc. I tried a pillow between my legs and it would just get kicked away at some point. I finally decided to get a pregnancy pillow and it\'s truly been a game-changer. Yes, I still wake up in the middle of the night to pee, but my quality of sleep is deeper, more restful, and I my growing belly and tired body feels much more supported and comfortable with this one piece to wrap around me. At 5\'8", it\'s the perfect size for me but not bulky so my husband still fits comfortable on our queen-sized bed. Highly recommend!'
b"Wow this thing is amazing!!!!! I'm not pregnant but I recently went through a breakup and was having trouble sleeping alone so I bought this hoping it would help. I got the first full nights sleep I'd had in weeks!!!I was worried it wouldn't be fluffy enough or big enough but it's actually totally perfect. It's just the right amount of support for my head and knees, and it's perfectly sized without completely taking over my bed. This is truly the best money I've spent in a while.Ironically, I feel more like a giant baby swaddled in a supportive cloud than a pregnant lady, but I'm quite happy about that!"
b"I was a little nervous about this pillow because I am very particular about my pillows. I usually sleep on a nice memory foam pillow so I'm a bit of a pillow snob. I'm not going to pretend it is as comfortable as my normal pillow but I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it is. I've only been using it about 2 weeks but it has worked great so far. It is supportive and full. I'm almost 23 weeks pregnant but I was already having trouble sleeping This pillow has definitely improved my sleeping. I'll update if any problems arise in the next 17 weeks but I have no reason to think there will be any issues."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not a big reviewer, and I am not pregnant but had back issues such that sleeping on my side without a pillow between my knees, or on my back without a pillow under my knees, was painful. And I always inevitably lost the pillow in the night.I bought this pillow seven months ago. I was worried this pillow would take over the bed but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t at all (though we have a king). I was worried it\xe2\x80\x99d it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be soft or would prevent my partner and me from cuddling. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t! I sleep with the \xe2\x80\x9cspine\xe2\x80\x9d of the pillow along the edge of the bed so my partner can still easily cuddle. I love the c shape because I can sleep either direction equally comfortably but I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel totally encased or trapped in the pillow. I sleep part of each night with my legs under the bottom curve (sleeping on my stomach) and can still use the top portion as a normal pillow comfortably. Over the last seven months anytime I have woken with pain in the night it has been because I stopped using the pillow on my legs temporarily and adjusting to use it again immediately has resolved my back pain.I used to struggle to fall asleep from my back and neck pain and my partner complained I stole his pillows to use between my knees and now I have NO PAIN with this pillow.The perfect thing about this pillow: it is large enough that it keeps you within it\xe2\x80\x99s borders automatically so you don\xe2\x80\x99t accidentally float out during the night. But it is not so large that you are stuck. I never have resented the pillow whereas I do often resent other objects in my bed (like my dog). I love it. It is soft. Mine at least seems to have a slightly more puffy half and a less puffy half so I keep the less puffy half for my sensitive (to too-tall pillows) neck. My only criticism of this pillow is that I prefer to sleep with down pillows so I wish the neck portion either could be switched out with a down insert, or could be removed to allow me to use my own down pillow for my neck.Temperature was also a big concern for me because I am both a VERY hot sleeper and occasionally a freezing cold sleeper. I have found that the pillow does not make me hotter at all, in fact, by keeping my legs from touching it helps me to keep cool, but when I am cold, curling up in it definitely helps to keep me warm.Overall, definitely a 5 star pillow, I\xe2\x80\x99m really glad I got a C shape rather than the bigger U options that I think would have felt a little claustrophobic and prevented cuddling. And I just wish it came with optional covers since I have a black dog who sheds! I also would buy multiple covers if available like a micro fleece winter cuddle option and a silkier summer option!K time to stop procrastinating on work. Love this pillow!!'
b"I'm 46 and bought this because I'm a side-sleeper with lower back pain.  I have degenerative disks in my back so it's pretty common to wake up with back pain.  This pillow is awesome and I'm so glad I bought it.  I can't remember the last time I was able to get comfortable so quickly and fall asleep.  Unless I was extremely tired I would toss and turn for awhile before drifting off to sleep.  That's not the case anymore.  I curl up with this thing and I'm out within 15-20 minutes every night.  It's like being spooned by a big fluffy teddy bear.  I'm a big fan now and highly recommend it."
b'The pillow is amazing. I got it when I was about 17wks and Im 20wks now. I had chronic lower back pain before pregnancy and it was starting to kick up a notch around 17wks (and beyond) so I got this pillow and it helps so much! Within 10 mins of laying in bed my back pain is gone. Its super comfortable to sleep on either side. As a bonus it also helps prevent me from sleeping on my back. Its firm but not too firm. Mine fluffed up perfect in the dryer. Id definitely recommend this pillow if you are pregnant and having any kind of pain. Or just pregnant. Its very supportive.'
b'This thing really helped save my back and hips during pregnancy! I am 5\xe2\x80\x992 and it wraps around me wonderfully. I use it for head and back and between my legs for hip support. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little cumbersome to move around in the middle of the night especially if you have a queen or smaller mattress. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long pillow, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a great pillow. You can be the big spoon and hug it for belly support or you can be the little spoon for head and knee/leg/hip support.  My husband is worried it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing him.'
b'I told myself after my first pregnancy that I could not go another one without one of these pillows. I was laying in bed at 20 weeks already with hip pain that woke me up constantly so I decided to hop on Amazon and found this great deal. This pillow is so wonderful! It has made a world of a difference in my sleep and aches. Here at 26 weeks, I am now sleeping through the night. I even bring this to the couch with me on movie nights.'
b"Ten weeks in and my body isn't happy. I bought this looking for relief. Oh man am I happy that I did. This will work for breastfeeding too! I can't sleep without it now and I'm not sure I'll sleep without it not pregnant!  I love this pillow. I use lots of pillows usually, and I can finally say that I don't need 12 pillows to sleep at night. I will update this after baby comes, I think it will replace the use for a boppy.  It's definitely bigger and bulkier but it feels like you're on a cloud."
b'I am currently pregnant with my first and am about 4 months along.  I had been having a lot of trouble getting sleep at night due to discomfort of growing baby.  Tossed and turned all night for a couple nights and was running on 3-4 hours of sleep each night.  I decided to give this pillow a try and am so glad I did.  I am now back to sleeping through the entire night with the help of this pillow.Thank you so much!'
b"I am very pleased with this pillow. During my pregnancy, I need to sleep on my side because my legs seem to fall asleep on my back, and this pillow helps prevent me from rolling onto my back in my sleep! It's comfortable, the right amount of firm, and provides the support I need for my head, neck, and back to remain aligned while on my side."
b"I never had trouble sleeping before I was pregnant and could literally sleep anywhere.  Lately I have found myself twisting and turning to get comfortable.  My lower back and legs would ache in the middle of the night and I was paranoid that I was sleeping on my back - I don't think I ever got into REM sleep.  Yesterday I got the maternity pillow and last night I got the best sleep!  I didn't wake up once and didn't find myself tossing and turning.  The pillow keeps your back supported while you are on your side.  It also lifts your leg up so that they remain parallel and takes pressure off.  I am so pleased with this product and feel so rested.  THANK YOU!"
b"I highly recommend this pillow! I wasn't willing to pay the price for a maternity pillow, because I felt like just a couple regular pillows would work. Being in my third trimester, I have started to have pains. I finally broke down and got one. I am so glad I spent the money! It's very comfortable and goes with your body as described. My other half uses the pillow too, and he looks and feels comfortable! My favorite part about the pillow is that all of my pains have gone away, and I cuddle with it. I can see myself using this after I give birth. If I knew how awesome this is, I would have gotten one before becoming pregnant! As odd as it sounds, it helps relieve anxiety as well."
b"It cuddles my every curve! Seriously it has made pregnancy a dream. I could not sleep and I was thrown off by the construction at 1st glace. After reading the reviews, and purchasing it is like I'm getting cuddled every night... And i don't have to do anything to get my cuddle *\xf0\x9f\x98\x89 \xf0\x9f\x98\x89* lol but seriously.. The best pillow ever!!"
b'I resisted getting a large maternity pillow like this for most of my pregnancy, fearing it would make me too hot in bed, and take up too much space, but after one night of adjusting to it, it is great!  Keeps me in a side position comfortably, and prevents me waking up on my back!'
b"Bought when I didn't want to be without a pregnancy pillow for an extending trip I was flying to. I didn't feel like checking a bag for just a pillow and this was a little better priced than buying a second snuggle so I took a chance. I think it worked about as well and I was happy to having it."
b'I am currently 7 months pregnant and struggled to sleep at night though out my whole pregnancy. First night I use this pillow and I actually slept ALL NIGHT!! Cost of the product was what drew me to this versus other brands but works all the same. I would DEFINATLY recommend this product!!! Lifesaver!'
b'I\'m 6\'1" and this thing is huge.  I love it!  It has enough give to be comfortable and soft, but still firm.  I need the firm to keep my belly in place and get some rest.  I just wish the other colors were the same price as the white one.  This this will be dirty in no time.'
b'Finally, I can sleep comfortable at night! Being pregnant, I was having a lot of trouble getting comfortable. This pillow has really improved that! I love that it comes in a case that can be easily washed as well.'
b'This pillow has been very helpful so far in my pregnancy. I purchased this pretty early because I started to get hip pain and this has minimized the pain. I forgot to pack it when we stayed at my parents and I definitely noticed the difference. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is pregnant and has hip pain at night.'

This is more on the expensive side for a pillow but well worth it considering the quality and comfort it provides. It is also comfortable in the seated position and provides a lot of support.'
b'Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly impressed! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this for one month so far! I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 19 weeks pregnant. The further along I get the more this helps me! My back gets sore during the day, so does my hips, calves, and feet. I also am experiencing round ligament pain on and off. This pillow really helps me sleep at night. It helps relieve round ligament pain. I find if I flip on my left side with the side pillow in between my legs it relieves the pain.

I can sleep in any position I please, besides on stomach...gotta protect the baby! I read other reviews that made me nervous to buy, but trust me, it works! It helps! At least for me! As for a size reference I am 5 foot 5 inches tall. I currently weigh 146 pounds, and it is working great for me!!! I love it! I used to sleep with a pile of pillows, now it\xe2\x80\x99s just the one! Hubs loves to cuddle up to the side of this thing too while I use it! I catch his head on it during the night! What can I say? I like this thing a ton! The only annoyance I have with it is the cleaning. In order to wash you have to remove the case and that looks like an honest pain, that\xe2\x80\x99s just because of how the pillow is shaped, it\xe2\x80\x99s an awkward thing to put a case on and off of. I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t mind to much though, I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m getting comfortable sleep for once! I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll use this after giving birth too!!!'
b'I bought for my pregnant sister. She said she bought 5 pillow, this one is the best. It support her very well so she can sleep more comfortable at night. I tried my self. Even I am not pregnant, but it is really nice for me. My back always feel muscle pain, I tried it as a cussion it feels so nice, i think I will buy one for myself as well.'
b'BEST PURCHASE OF MY LIFE! I have terrible, awful sleep, but this made a difference. (It didn\xe2\x80\x99t cure my sleep issues, but it sure improved my sleep substantially) This has improved my sleep quality immensly! Im not pregnant, so this pillow is for everyone. I usually toss and turn all night, but thr first night I slept with this pillow I laid down in position and woke up in the exact position. My husband said I didnt move at all through the night, (he\xe2\x80\x99s up pretty late). I woke up feeling like I actually slept for once.I freaking LOVE that I can fold it in all these different positions to sit up, sleep on my back but raised when my nose is stuffed up, be able to roll over without adjusting my pillow, but my favorite part is while I lay on one arm of the pillow my husband uses the other arm of it!I was worried the pillow would take up to much space on our bed, but even when my husband isnt using the other arm he has plenty of space on his side. I mean jf anything, he has more space because I\xe2\x80\x99m not invading his side.The only negative, is the frustration of getting the case back on because of the odd shape. And not really frustrating more like silly because I suck a putting the fitted sheet on the bed too.'
b"I love this pillow so much that bought another one 2 weeks later for the vacation home. I have pains (neck, arm, hip) due to sleeping on my stomach and purchased this pillow to help me sleep on my side and eventually sleep more on my back. At first the top of the pillow was too high for me, but I read to remove some stuffing if needed. Instead I pushed some of the stuffing into the 'legs' of the pillow and now it is perfect for me. Now I rarely have body pains from sleeping. I highly recommend it. And, again, you can always adjust the pillow to your needs by unzipping the top and removing or moving the stuffing around."
b"I bought 2 of these pillows, 1 for my mom and 1 for me. I bought this when I started having trouble sleeping because of my pregnancy and now that I'm further in, I have no idea what I did without it! This pillow is incredibly supportive in all of the right places and ensures supreme comfort. I was skeptical because I'm 6'2 but it still fits me perfectly! My mom has had multiple back surgeries and back problems over the year but this pillow has provided her with some of the best sleep of her life! Regardless of why you need it, this pillow will help!"
b"I'm now seven months pregnant with my second child and I've had this pillow for about two months... I have to say that this is one of the best purchases I've ever made regarding my pregnancy! I was miserable sleeping before with my first baby, using tons of pillows, constantly having to resituate them and just being plain uncomfortable. This pillow is amazing! It gives support in all the right places and it's nice not having to move a million pillows to get comfortable. Even if I roll onto my back while sleeping, the other side still props me up slightly to the side, it's great. I highly recommend this pillow to any mama!"
b"I had a body pillow through pregnancy that was juts one of those long, straight ones. I would start off at night sleeping on top of it and wake up with it between my knees, but with an aching back. When it was time to replace it, I looked for one of this shape, and it's perfect. It's flat enough that it doesn't get in the way, but still goes between my knees and supports my back (my hips tend to ache if I sleep right on them, another problem this pillow solves). Sometimes I sleep with another pillow under my head, sometimes I just use this. Be warned that if you want something fluffy, this isn't it. It's been fairly compressed since I got it, but that's exactly what I need."
b"Love love love this pillow! Since getting it, I have had the best sleep I've had in years! My bones ache if they connect, so I've always needed a pillow between my knees and ankles.  Then I would wake up to move those pillows every time I needed to turn over.  This  pillow eliminated both the need for the separate pillows AND I don't have to wake up when I turn over.  I only wish I had discovered it sooner!"
b"I have not had the pillow long.  Also, I am not pregnant.  However I have lower back pain.  Since using this pillow.  I have slept very well.  I sleep a lot longer and wake with way less pain if any than before.  I love the pillow.  I can not speak to it's durability because I have not had it long.  However, just from the few nights sleep I have had so far.  I would purchase it again.  Because of it, I am a better person in the morning.  If you ask my kids.  That is saying a lot.  lol"
b"I bought this a week before having abdominal surgery. I had a lower body lift after losing a large amount of weight and I knew I'd need good support during my recovery. I absolutely LOVE this body pillow! I slept like a baby the first night I used it. I have never slept with more than a pillow under my head but this pillow changed that, it's that comfortable. If you have any doubts at all, put them aside and buy this amazing pillow!"
b'I was skeptical about buying a \xe2\x80\x9cpregnancy pillow\xe2\x80\x9d of any kind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend the money for something I would only use a few months. BUT I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep in about 3 months and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer. So glad I took the plunge with this pillow! I got it Friday and this weekend I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten more sleep than I think I have in the last month alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s super comfortable and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up the whole entire bed so my husband has at least a little room too. :) It\xe2\x80\x99s just the right amount of firmness and not to high so my neck doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt in the mornings. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found a position yet that\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable so if you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to get comfy at night, this pillow is a must have!'
b'Around 16 weeks I was restless , I had so much pressure in my back it was unreal. That pressure only worsened as I grew , so I\xe2\x80\x99m now 23 weeks and decided to buy a pregnancy pillow. I almost bought the one from target until I had seen a picture showing how flat it was, I read the reviews for this one and decided to try it out, I bought the all blue pillow and the cover on it was actually comfortable. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t left it inflate much as I was incredibly eager to try it out , but right away I loved the way it made my back feel. I had errands to run so I guess it inflated more while I was gone , when I laid with it the second time it was amazing. It\xe2\x80\x99s very full, and worth every bit of the money , I haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept this well in a while! ( Also my husband who has back problems  from a surgery LOVED it because of the pressure relief.  Choose this pillow ladies!'
b"I LOVE this pillow.  It took a night to get used to it.  It feels different than my last pillow, but once I gave it a chance I was glad!  I am a larger lady and it still fits me in it.. the sides easily move in and out if needed.  The pillow case is a bit tricky to get on, but it's not that hard... just takes time and two people is easier."
b"This was a dream come true for my pregnant daughter. She was so uncomfortable at night until this pillow came. She was in heaven. She was able to sleep better at night without interruption. The added advantage is that she still uses it now for her and the baby wether to breastfeed or to prop him up. It's worth the money.  It did come a day later as promised with prime, but the item itself is good."
b"I LOVE this pillow! Its so big first of all. Secondly it comes pressed but once you take it out it expands and you fluff it up it works wonders. I don't sleep with any other pillow but this one. I can switch from the left to the right side. My kitten loves this pillow he sleeps with me on it! I haven't washed it yet but I am soon. But so far excellent I recommend it! By the way I ain't pregnant I just needed a pillow that was more comfy and for the full body. So even if you not pregnant get it!!!!"
b'This pillow has been amazing throughout my pregnancy! I love to snuggle but end up getting too hot when snuggled with hubby or with our pups so the pillow is the perfect solution. It is the perfect firmness for me but there is also an option to unzip and remove some padding if needed. I bought an extra pillow case for it to use if the other one needs to be washed. I toss from side to side throughout the night and the U-shape makes it easy to just turn and switch my legs over to the other side. I would highly recommend for anyone pregnant or not!'
b"My mom got me this pillow around 20 weeks pregnant. I'm currently 39 weeks pregnant and let me say this pillow has been a LIFE SAVER!! I love it. I still sleep at least 75% of the night and I give credit to this pillow. I would recommend this pillow to any pregnant woman or anyone have trouble sleeping due to lack of support. It is a rather big pillow, but I have a king size bed so it wasn't an issue for me. The only thing that's kind of annoying is getting the pillow case on and off for washing, but hey that's a pretty minor issue for the benefits of this pillow. Overall Definitely deserves 5 stars."
b'I bought this using my husband\'s account. I love this pillow. I bought it for back support during my pregnancy and also to keep me from rolling over on my back. I am 5\'5" and it reaches my knees when I have my head on it and lie flat. It does offer good back support. This pillow is firm which I love. I have been looking for a firm pillow for a long time. All the ones you get at the store that say extra firm, etc., are a joke. I never thought a pregnancy pillow would be the answer. So if you like soft pillows, you probably won\'t like this pillow. It will definitely see me through my pregnancy and I am very happy with my purchase.'
b'My wife loved this thing! It was definitely a must during her pregnancy. She used it everyday 7 weeks on bedrest at home then 7 more weeks on bedrest in the hospital. Had to buy another cover for it so we could swap em out every once in a while. Should have seen the looks I got carrying it into the hospital. Everyone was jealous.'

b'I love this pillow. I am currently 26 weeks pregnant, and I purchased this at 22 weeks. I was already starting to have difficulty sleeping comfortably even though my belly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that big yet. After a few nights of sleeping with this pillow, I now cannot live without it.We have a queen bed and this is a large pillow so it takes up a good amount of the bed, but my husband still has enough room. I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided it works best to remove my regular pillow from the bed completely and then use the Boppy pillow for sleeping on both my right and left side. It takes a second to flip it over but it\xe2\x80\x99s not too much of a hassle. The support this pillow provides is amazing.My only real complaint is that I think it would work best for smaller women. I am 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d and 140 (pre-pregnancy), and when I place my head on the pillow where it is most comfortable (about a foot from top far end), the thin spot where your belly is supposed to be is above my belly. I think this could be solved if they had multiple sizes for multiple height ranges. I am not sure if this pillow would be as comfortable for someone significantly taller than me.Overall though, this pillow is amazing and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I got it. Pregnancy is already expensive enough, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to waste money on something unnecessary. But this was so worth it! If you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to find a pregnancy pillow, I say go for it!'
b'I love this pillow! After weeks of not being able to get comfortable at night and lots of tossing and turning, I decided to order this pillow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only slept with it two night so far, but I have slept through both nights with only having to get up to go to the bathroom. Before, I was waking up no less than 6 times a night and getting very little actual sleep. I tried one of the full u shaped pregnancy pillows earlier in my pregnancy, but that was too confining and too big for my queen bed. This one is the perfect size! I sleep with a cpap machine and mask, so I thought there would be issues with the cords, but so far no issues. The best sleep I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in a long time.'
b'I love this pillow. So glad I bought it early in my pregnancy when sleeping had just started to be uncomfortable, now at 36 weeks I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could sleep without it.  It fits around my body and is the perfect shape to cuddle around. It helped with my back and hip pain. I was worried at first it might be too big for our full sized bed and push my husband out, but it fits fine. Also great to fold in half and use to recline comfortably. Definitely recommend.'
b"Absolutely love this pillow! I am 21 weeks pregnant and I can finally get a good night's rest. Other pillow are ok, but the bobby is so diverse and does not take up the entire bed! I also just fold it in half upward for when I get up to go to the bathroom! No more fully removing pillows to get out of bed!"
b"It really helped me during pregnancy. I didn't use as a head pillow, just used for the rest of my body. It is easily adaptable to your needs. I highly recommended it."
b"I'd gotten to the point at the end of my 2nd trimester where I just can't get comfortable to sleep the whole night through.  I don't know that I'm sleeping the whole night through yet, but this definitely made me more comfortable and I'm at least in less pain."
b'Bought for my daughter & she loves it! Provides the support she  wants and needs! She said that she is finally able to get the sleep she needs!'
b'Wife loves it!'
b'I can sleep!!!'
b'Love it! It took a little time to figure out how to position it for my body and get most comfortable, but it has fit throughout my pregnancy!'
b'For the woman an she said she loves it..'
b'soft, supportive and easy to adjust while sleeping. perfect for expecting and new moms alike'
b'Saved me from severe discomfort in my 8th month of pregnancy. I had shoved it aside for a few months but needed it again and now all those sleepless nights of not being able to get comfortable are gone because of the proper support to the bump, under the knees and under the back. So glad I got this! Life saver.'
b'My wife is currently pregnant and uses it every single night. A must have product while pregnant!'
b'No more tossing and turning. I\xe2\x80\x99m 36 weeks so it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten harder to sleep. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how a pillow can make such a big difference but it does. Good value too as many other pillows cost almost double. Perfect gift for any mom to be.'
b'Pillow is very comfy and a little bigger than I thought, but it gives my back and belly support.'
b'My daughter loves it.'
b'This pillow was the answer to my sleep problems. It got me through pregnancy. Only complaint is that its size and shape made it hard to store.'
b'Daughter loved this during her pregnancy! Still uses it for sleep and for play w baby'
b'Loved my pillow helped relieve the pressure from laying on my left side and helped me get rest.'

b'Used this from about 20 weeks pregnant to help me sleep on my side. I use it every night and am now 39 weeks and 4 days. It is a life safer!! The cover stretches a little with use, but shrinks back once you wash it. Picture is my 39 week belly.Careful though, if your dog is like mine, it might try to steal it every time you get out of bed to use the restroom! Haha'
b'This pillow is a life saver.  Since the start of my 2nd trimester, I\'ve been trying my hardest to sleep on my sides and not my back as is suggested.  But I would keep waking up on my back or tossing from side to side with sore hips.  Since purchasing this pillow a couple of weeks ago, I only turn over perhaps once during the night from one side to the other.  And it keeps me from rolling onto my back.  My husband has been able to sleep more soundly too because I\'m not moving all around due to discomfort.  I\'m 21 weeks now, and there is still plenty of "room" for my belly to grow with this pillow.  This is also much more reasonable to fit into a queen sized bed with my husband than one of the huge U or C shaped pregnancy pillows.'
b'Oh my goodness! This is the first good night sleep I\'ve had since I hit 30 weeks. This pillow "hugs" my growing belly and back. I can toss and turn and expect support on either side. Highly recommend it if your pregnant and have hits that stage where every resting or sleeping position is uncomfortable. This his will definitely help. For reference, I also bought the long body pillow that curves like a "C" and this is way better for support and way more practical.'
b"This pillow is great. I was using one of the big C-shape pillows, but I missed using my real pillow for my head. I could never get quite comfortable on the c-shape pillow. I feel like my belly wasn't big enough to benefit from the large shape, but you can be uncomfortable during sleep in pregnancy long before your belly gets huge. This side sleeper pillow is perfect for me becuase I am usually a back sleeper. It keeps me from rolling onto my back in my sleep, but it gives nice support in the front without being too bulky. My husband likes this pillow much better because he gets his whole side of the bed back. Some reviews state there's an issue with the fabric stretching out. It does stretch some, but not enough to be an issue for at least a month. I've been using it about two weeks, and I have slept so much better since switching! I do have to kind of sit up to roll over to the other side, but I had to do that with the c-shape pillow, too. If you have trouble staying off your back, but you want to be able to use your own pillow for your head, get this pillow!"
b"Omg ladies if you are a back sleeper like me and can't get comfy or sleep while Preggo and find yourself rolling over constantly this is your new best friend. I love this thing it doesn't look like it would be big enough of fluffy/sturdy enough but let me tell you it provides great back and belly support I wish I got this sooner . It's super soft easily washed and can be adjusted easily for when you switch sides. I recommend this fully and hope it can help others ."
b"I absolutely love this pillow.  Sleeping on my back has been an impossible habit to break during pregnancy. This pillow has made it much easier. It's perfect to lay on your side with one bump supporting your growing belly and the other preventing you from rolling to your back. I also use it occasionally as a support around my knee area. I've already washed the cover and it came out of the wash & dryer perfect. This is also a super convenient pillow to travel with.  I travel a lot for work so a giant pregnancy pillow just wouldn't do.  This has proved to be the perfect travel companion during pregnancy!"
b"I'm so in love with this pillow! I have had bad back pain while sleeping every night since there first trimester and nothing helped.A friend gave me her snoogle pillow and it helped a little but I still want sleeping well. Found this and am now sleeping again finally in the 3rd trimester. I even lived on it for 3 weeks when I had the flu. Best preggo purchase I've made!"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 5 1/2 months pregnant and I have been \xe2\x80\x9csleeping\xe2\x80\x9d very uncomfortable, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want to call waking up all through the night and being sore when I wake up. With my last pregnancy I had the full wrap around pregnancy pillow but it just takes up way to much room in the bed although it was very comfortable. THIS IS THE BEST MONEY I\xe2\x80\x99VE SPENT! LOVE LOVE LOVE this pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s small but yet big enough, supportive, durable, the cover comes off for an easy wash, and it is the actual boppy pillow brand. And I love that the support is for my belly and back and I can also use this pillow for in between my knees if needed because I can just use the one pillow and also if you sit up on the couch/chair and put the middle piece behind your back then the pillow are on each side of you perfect for your elbows when nursing/feeding so I\xe2\x80\x99ll get plenty of use out of this!'
b"I've been using this for about a month now so it's safe to say my opinion is verified. This pillow is every bit as amazing now as it was the first day I used it. I love it so much!  It really gives me great support for both my belly and my back and makes my nights much easier."
b"Really helpful for my back. I was having a lot of trouble sleeping from about week 20 and on, but this pillow really helped me find a comfortable way to sleep. Now at 32 weeks, I am extremely glad I found this! It is small enough to travel and doesn't disrupt sleeping with another person in the bed. My husband actually really likes it because the edge of the pillow provides some back support for him too! It's also very easy to clean and to just take the pillows out of the case and throw the case in the wash. Some other reviews mentioned it not having enough room in-between the pillows, which I can see, but after a day or two of sleeping with it, the case stretches a little (like any fabric does) and it gets roomier."
b'My hips had been killing me especially when I woke up in the morning... my sister insisted that I get this pillow although I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how it would help my hips. I did know that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a pillow that would take up too much space or keep me from using my current head/neck pillow. So, I decided to give this one a shot. I LOVE IT. Of course I still need separate pillows for my knees and to rest my arm on, but, this pillow made a night and day difference in my hip pain. I\xe2\x80\x99m 24 weeks now, hopefully the relief will last the full 40.'
b"I never write a review, but this was worth it. I was hesitant about the price, but it really is TOTALLY WORTH IT! I was using normal pillows and it just wasn't doing it for me, i bought this and its A SLEEP CHANGER!!! Its sooooooo comfy, I cant get over how comfortable it is!!! The size in-between is perfect, the pillow its self are super cushion-y so your bump is not tight, its so so so perfect"
b'I love that this pillow supports the bump AND my back. It makes sleeping so much more comfortable, even if sleepy me stubbornly keeps trying to lay on my back, this pillow helps keep me on my side.'
b'Update: Im now 35 weeks and this pillow still has me sleeping pretty well. Not sure what I\xe2\x80\x99d do without it!I\xe2\x80\x99m 23 weeks and have just started to get into the back pain. So fair this pillow has been great. I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping better with no pain. It supports my back and stomach very nicely and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up the whole bed. (It does take a couple nights to get used to.)'
b'This pillow is great. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about rolling on my back during these last couple months of the pregnancy. I read some reviews that said it was too small. I am a pretty small person normally, and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fit over my belly now- at 9 months pregnant. However, I just put it on both sides of my chest and it is fine. If you are big busted and far along it may not work for you, but I have found it to be really helpful. It offers me plenty of support and is soft and comfortable.'
b'This is my second pregnancy, and this pillow is a godsend. I used the snoogle during my first pregnancy and quickly became frustrated at how difficult it was to maneuver around it for multiple nighttime bathroom trips. I also didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that the Snoogle prevented me from using my own head pillow. This hugs me perfectly at night, gives me back support so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t roll completely flat, which is my tendency, and gives me something to hug for balance. I use it with the other curved hoppy pillow between my knees. I have a short torso and am 5\xe2\x80\x9d2, for reference.'
b"I originally purchased a big U pillow but have had issues with it causing a lot of neck pain because it props my head up a lot more than my regular pillow.This pillow is the best, it feels like a big hug while you're sleeping and makes me SO much more comfortable than without it. Currently at 16 weeks and am sleeping SO much better with this."
b"Comfortable, doesn't feel like the bed is crowded, and soft. I don't like the zippers, though.... the wrong position, and I can feel them digging into me. I bought it so I wouldn't roll onto my back, and so far it has not helped even a little bit. I think my sleeping self is just determined to be a back sleeper. But all the same, it offers good support."
b"I was having trouble not rolling onto my back while sleeping, and did not like the giant C-shaped pregnancy pillow I tried. This pillow has just enough support on either side to let you roll over without too much trouble but makes it hard to end up flat on your back, which is what I wanted.Some reviewers mentioned that the pillowcase stretches out some after use- I have found that this can be remedied by taking one half of the pillow and flipping it over to create a small twist in the pillowcase fabric in between. I can't feel the twist in the fabric when I'm sleeping, but it tightens the pillowcase up just enough to make sure the pillows stay snug on either side of me."
b"I have always been a back sleeper. During my first pregnancy, I used a Leachco Snoogle pillow, and would always wake up on top of the pillow, on my back. It wasn't very comfortable, or very supportive, and getting into bed or turning over was a time-consuming chore. I have never been able to successfully sleep all night on my side, until I got this Boppy pillow. I was skeptical at first, but this pillow is incredible. It is comfortable to sleep in, but supportive enough to keep me on my side all night. I also don't wake up with back or shoulder pain, like I did with the Snoogle. A further welcome benefit is its size: it is much smaller than other pregnancy pillows, and takes up much less space in the bed."

b"UPDATED 6/2/17 - the first one was exceptional so ordered a second. that one looked okay BUT after one night found it had 'leaked' many of the very tiny round white rubber microbeads all over the sheets. amazon was great, they sent a replacement out even before i had the chance to send in the faulty one back. the replacement i received was just as good as the first e.g. zero issues. fyi i am guessing that the seams on that 2nd one weren't tight enough, separating just enough under pressure to allow those very tiny beads to leak out.  i have had no problems whatsoever since.a decade ago, a bike accident & surgeries which left me with upper neck problems. i have tried every type of pillow i could find in hopes of getting a decent night's rest. so many i've lost count. be they memory foam pillows, down, shredded foam, fiber fill, seed husk, etc. none worked for me.then i thought to give this one a try & i could not be happier. this flat style micro-bead pillow is as said BETTER THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF PILLOW i have ever used. i no longer wake due to pain, needing to move around. bonus benefit so to speak, it stays 'cool.' as to size it is a bit smaller than a standard sized pillow but works better than all those other full sized pillows in large part because it does NOT compress down so much. anyone who has used memory foam pillow knows what i am referring to.*this is an excellent replacement for a full sized pillow especially for those who have upper back/neck problems.>>Updated 5/23/17 - my experience with the pillow was so positive i ordered a second as a spare. i never want to risk going back to those old pillow types again.<<"
b'I tried many other pillows that claimed to stop sore neck muscles, with mixed results.These work quite well.Comfortable.Not hot like some are.Appears to be well made, time will tell.'
b"Everyone has different preferences, but this is the perfect pillow for me and it's affordable. Unlike other pillows I've bought that felt like I was sleeping on a brick. This gives a great support and molds to your neck without the overly firm feeling memory foam has.Tip: I wish this company made pillow cases that fit this pillow. My pillow cases fit, but are too big and slide off of it."
b'It worked great for my neck pain, I did realize that it works better if you adjust your head in the middle of the pillow. ;)'
b'I now have 2 of these.  Really like the smaller size for travel.  Also works good to go on top of another pillow if you are a side sleeper.  Makes space for shoulder.  This really supports my neck well.'
b'I  find it cool and comfortable. It adjusts to the  movement of  my head.I do not hear the sounds that others have mentioned.'
b'Love it is relaxing and contours to your head and neck.  Glad they have come out with pillow case.'
b'This will be a cuddle pillow when it relaxes a bit. It will conform to a head, or an arm wrapped around it. Ordered two and plan to order two more. Great to use while watching television. I love love love it.'
b'This is a replacement pillow.  I finally wore out the one I had.'
b"These pillows work well for me.  wish they'd added a case.  Will not buy without case again."
b"My family has a unique story behind this pillow.  My husband has sleep apnea and had this pillow for himself.  When my grandson Tech was born in Jan of 2016 my daughter used it to prop his bottle.  Well Tech took his Pawpaw's pillow and grew very attached to it, so much he couldnt sleep with out it.  It took me until now to actually find the pillow again.  I purchased and new for Tech because the old one was just done for.  I also had to buy a new for Pawpaw to replace the one he lost two years ago."
b'I have not used this product yet, because I have not made it a pillow case.  It was bought to be used following back surgery which has not happened yet.  It supports in all the right place so I think it will be perfect.  Very well made and appears to be very sturdy for frequent use.'
b'Love this pillow!  This little pillow has provided a comfortable sleep for me.  I used to wake up with a sore neck from my other pillow.  Since this pillow is so squishy and can be manipulated to contour to my head/neck, I can make it a perfect fit no matter what my position in bed.  I would buy this again!'
b'It worked great for my neck pain, I did realize that it works better if you adjust your head in the middle of the pillow. ;)'
b"These are the BEST pillows you can get for aches and pains. I bought a bunch of them for my mom and she sticks them all around - under the arms, head, neck, etc. Easy to take with you too. Takes off the pressure and super comfortable. Also they stay cool and don't make you sweat like memory foam does."
b'I like this pillow it conforms to my head It is very comfortable'
b'This is an excellent replacement for my previous beaded pillow sold on Tv.  It is larger and a little  fuller.  It did not come with a pillowcase .  I can sew one up in a couple minutes or spend all day trying to find one in the right size.  Good price.'
b'A life saver.  I have neck problems that prevent me from using a regular pillow.  With this pillow i can sleep comfortably and  awake pain free.  Works best with case that stretches.'
b"I was looking for a more affordable microbead pillow as my cat had taken over one of them that was supposed to be mine!  She loves kneading in this one.  It's her favorite place to nap.  So 4 paws up on this one."
b'I now have 2 of these.  Really like the smaller size for travel.  Also works good to go on top of another pillow if you are a side sleeper.  Makes space for shoulder.  This really supports my neck well.'

b"This cover made the pillow worth owning. I hate that these pillows are so expensive and the stock cover (if you even get the one that has a cover) is plain awful. This jersey cover is super soft, fit perfectly, was WAY easier to get on and off then the one the pillow comes with, and was a pretty color. I wasn't happy with my pillow at all until I put this cover on it. Then it didn't leave my bed through the rest of the pregnancy."
b"I bought it for my better half I originally bought her one of those body pillows got that covered to replace the one that was on it she loves it it's easy zip on and feels good she's been quite pleased with it if somebody has one of those body pillows I would suggest to buy one like I said they're really nice she really likes it. It was a good buy on my part so again it's quality and it would be something I would recommend"
b"Are you kidding me? Best thing ever! I bought the snoogle pillow, but it comes with a white cover, that is super hard to take in or out. I have a dark hair chihuahua so I was DESPERATE for a solution because all his hair stick to my pillow and I had to be cleaning it with a linen roll 2 to 3 times a day. I also had to be washing it once a week, which wouldn't be a problem if the original cover it brings was easy to put back in. Anyways I decided to give this cover a shot and I LOVE IT!!!!! For me it was problem solved. It is super easy to put in due to its big zipper.The color is beautiful (teal) and the material super soft."
b"So comfy! I bought this to cover my Snoogle and prevent it from messing up like the first one I had ruined. I didn't use a cover for my first pregnancy and those nights where I didn't feel like cleaning my eyeliner left smudges on my white snoogle. Bad idea and you can't even wash it. Save yourself trouble and buy a cover so you can keep your Snoogle like new. I wouldn't recommend a different cover because they're not comfortable. This jersey material is wonderful and doesn't make you hot."
b'Gave in and purchased this, tried to hold out and used a standard pillow case on my snoogle so that it was easy to wash, and much softer than the white cover that comes with the pillow. I got tired of adjuating my standard pillow case because it shifted during the night. Purchased this Jersey one bc read the other non-jersey covers you can purchase separately were easier to remove with zipper, but no softer than the cheap, rough white one the pillow comes with. This is a decent material, and zipper/removal friendly also. A little tight getting on at first but stretches with time, and washing.'
b'This is IMO a necessary accessory for the Snoogle as it goes on and off much easier than the cover which comes on the Snoogle - we wrestled the original cover off for one washing and putting it back on was a nightmare.  (The two ends are not the same, lay it out flat first to avoid trying to put it on the wrong end.)  I decided to invest in the cover.  Very glad we did tho it adds to the total cost of the Snoogle..  Still, like any pillow case, you really need to be able to wash it!!!  This cover washed in machine and dried in the dryer just fine.  Color is true and lovely.'
b"Fits my Snoogle perfectly!  Washes very well and is extremely soft, I love the feel of it.  Now I wouldn't say it is easy to get on, but I would say its probably as easy as its going to get with a pillow this size and shape.  There is a zipper along the back and you basically have to stick the two ends of the pillow in first then zip up.  There is going to have to be some maneuvering and wiggling to get the ends all the way in but after a few times you'll get the hang of it."
b"After reading the reviews I wasn't sure what I'd get, but this cover is actually nicer than the original one my snoogle came with! It's very soft, easy to wash and it's pretty color. I'm glad to have two!"
b'Loved this pillow cover kind of expensive! It did away with my lower back pain almost completely who would have thought that sleeping on your stomach or back would lead to horrible back pain! This pillow corrected that with in a couple of weeks it takes some time getting use to but it even stops you from snoring  and tossing an turning at night.'
b"These covers are great! I love the ease of removing and replacing the cover on my Snoogle with these zippered covers. They are 100% easier to remove and replace for washing than struggling with the default style cover with the single slit-opening. When you're heavy with baby, every second you spend stooping makes your back hurt worse, and means you're more likely to loose your balance, and sitting down and twisting your torso is just as bad; these covers shorten that time due to on/off ease."
b"this cover is soooo much better than the cover that comes with the snoogle itself.  it not only feels nicer and looks better but is much easiser to put on the pillow because it zips up.  the one i received is actually a little more turquoise-y then the deep blue shown in the picture and i like it even better.  yes, it's a little pricey just for a pillow case but you're paying for the shape and convenience of not having to immediately wash and dry the one cover that comes with it."
b"SUPER SOFT!!!! I'm not an expecting mother but my mom got the snoogle for me as a gift last Christmas and I needed a cover for it. LOVE this cover!!! Color is amazing and it's super soft!! Highly recommend!"
b"Let's be honest, the Snoggle pillow is expensive but so blasted comfortable when pregnant, except for the cheap, scratchy standard cover that comes with it.  I hated to pay another thirty bucks for this replacement cover, but am now glad I did. It's a very soft cotton jersey fabric, with a good zipper on the back side. It's much more comfortable than the standard cover and waaaaaaay easier to take on/off for washing."
b"I got the teal colored cover because it matches our bed sheets. I like the color it's exactly as pictured. The zipper makes this really easy to put on unlike the original cover that comes with the pillow. The fabric itself is very very soft. It is thin like a favorite t-shirt worn and washed several times. I like it, but some might think that it's not sturdy. If you want a soft cover this one is certainly soft. I've only had it for a couple of days so I can't attest to durability, but so far it's working just fine."
b'This was so much easier to put on than the original cover I had with my body pillow. It fits great and the fabric is nice and soft. Love that is is washer and dryer safe as well.'
b"I love love LOVE my Snoogle- and this cover is absolutely perfect! It's a pretty color, the fabric is nice and soft, and it's super easy to put on and take off of the Snoogle pillow. It holds up perfectly in the wash as well."
b'my husband called it the C%%K Block pillow...but i LOVED it while i was pregnant.  it saved my back and helped with pinched nerves...aslo helped with all that weight being on my shoulder all the time from having to lay on my side'
b"This has been a life-saver for me.  I am now nearing the start of my third trimester and it's the only way I can sleep at night.  I would suggest getting a slipcover with it.  I like the feel of the jersey slipcover a little better as, to me, the pillow itself is a little scratchy.  All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase."
b"Fits the original snoogle very well. I didn't have any trouble fitting the curvy part of the pillow into the cover.The material is nice and soft."
b'Soft cover, fits great on the snoogle pillow. The package came on time and it looks as it is described by the seller.'

b'I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.My wife was having trouble sleeping since becoming pregnant and purchased the regular sized Queen Rose U Shaped pillow, from which she greatly benefits. It supports her to sleep on either side, which she had a hard time doing before as she is usually a back sleeper and stacking up pillows does not have the same effect. Immediately seeing how it could benefit me as well, I decided to try the King Size pillow (being over 6\xe2\x80\x99 tall, the regular size wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long enough).Laying flat with each side even and straight, the full size of the pillow is about 33\xe2\x80\x9d wide and 64\xe2\x80\x9d long, with each side about 10\xe2\x80\x9d wide. It is well made, soft, and feels nice. The removable cover is a useful feature.The pillow is quite large and if you are sharing a bed with a partner, you will likely want to have at least a queen size bed. If both partners have a pillow, a king size bed is recommended (we didn\xe2\x80\x99t fit too well when we both tried them on our old queen, but we were already upgrading to a split king anyway, so it worked out). If you are sleeping alone, a twin bed will work.I have been using the pillow for a few weeks now and really like it. Being a side sleeper who used to sleep with a second pillow between my legs, it offers support on each side so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have switch the pillow back and forth. It also provides a natural place for both arms, which has always been an issue. I feel better when waking up in the morning (I have persistent shoulder, back, and neck pain) so there may be some pain reduction benefits, although as mentioned above we purchased a new bed around the same time, so it is hard to tell which one is making the difference (I suspect both are contributing). I did use it a few days on our old bed and felt better than with my old pillow. It is too soon to tell whether there will be any long-term pain reduction, although sleeping in more functional positions is a step in the right direction.There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether to purchase a body pillow and which one to choose. This King Size is better for those who are taller or want to manipulate the pillow in various positions. It is softer and the inner material is adjustable by design. This can be a good feature, but also a potential drawback as it can be challenging to get everything just right, although I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found it to be too big of an issue, as I like that I can move in various positions at night and adjust the pillow accordingly with minimal effort. My wife tried the King Size and found it comfortable, but prefers the firmer, shorter (she\xe2\x80\x99s 5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d) pillow. If anyone wants a longer, firmer pillow, additional material could easily be added to the King Size, as there is a opening with a zipper at the top of the pillow.Overall, the Queen Rose pillows are high quality and do what they are supposed to, providing a good option for pregnant and non-pregnant sleepers, female and male (if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t bothered by the odd looks you\xe2\x80\x99ll get when telling people you bought a pregnancy pillow). Having never used a body pillow, my wife and I are very satisfied, although with no basis for comparison, I cannot say whether a cheaper body pillow would offer the same of similar benefits. For pregnancy, it is definitely a worthwhile purchase.'
b"Fits me perfectly and I'm not pregnant.  I feel like I am wrapped up in a cloud.  I'm a side sleeper with bottom leg straight and top leg bent; bottom arm usually under the pillow.  I've always had headaches, neck and shoulder pain from pillows that flatten out or are too thick.  Recently, I started getting bad hip pain and chiropractor recommended a pillow to keep top knee elevated.  Using a regular pillow was cumbersome as was the smaller knee pillows with an elastic strap to attach to one knee, resulting in sleep disruptions every time I tried to turn over.  This U-shaped pillow is perfect for me.  No more headaches, neck, shoulder and hip pain after the first night of use.  The stuffing is firm enough that it doesn't flatten out under my head and knees.  I find I'm sleeping much more soundly and don't wake up during the night just to turn over.  The first night, the outside pillow leg did fall off the bed but I must have figured out how to flip over without pushing it off because it hasn't happened since.  So far, I have not had any problems being too hot, which was an initial concern.  I'm totally thrilled with my purchase and highly recommend this pillow."
b"I was hesitant to order this pillow because it seemed to focus more on pregnant women, than any other people.  About 6 months ago I started waking up with horrendous lower back pain.  One time it took me 30 minutes to even make it to the bathroom because of the pain.  Once I was able to move in a vertical position my pain would work its way out and I was fine.  At home I started sleeping on my sofa where I did not have this problem.  When visiting my son's family, out of state, I began to have the same problem.  I purchased the bed I slept in a few years ago and was surprised to suddenly have this same thing happen after years of sleeping in the bed.  I decided I needed to get off my sofa and back to my bed so I made the purchase.  I also bought a pillow case.  The pillow case was more difficult to put on but eventually I tried the pillow out.  I woke up the next morning without any lower back pain.  After a couple of days, I decided to sleep without it again (sort of a test).  Again I had lower back pain, not severe, but it was there. This morning I went back onto Amazon and ordered another pillow and pillow case and it will be delivered to my son's house. My first thought when the back problems started was the bed.  I have an air bed at home so I can adjust the hardness very easily.  I finally decided the problem was I tossed and turned too much and this put a strain on my lower back.  When I slept on the sofa I could not toss and move around which prevented the strain on my back. So even if you are not pregnant, I gave this pillow a definite 5 stars"
b"excellent quality, great stuffing, and while I need to fluff it back after a couple nights sleep, I suppose no other pillow can get away without fluffing. The quality is very good on this and the pillow case was easy to clean and reapply. the instructions are very clear (no washing the inner pillow, hang dry the case) and this really is much more comfortable than the moonlight slumber comfort u pillow. In particular, this pillow does a better job of hugging me and supporting my legs than the comfort u. I found the comfort u was too wide and the support was almost nil after a couple nights. it didn't fluff back up either. The Queen Rose u pillow has held up AWESOMELY for over a month already."
b'If I could give this pillow 10 million stars I would!! I am 55 years old and have scoliosis. I have been chasing chiropractors and physical therapists around for the past year with chronic daily low back, mid back, and neck pain. If one area didn\'t hurt the other ones did. I even tried sleeping on the floor for a few weeks. I bought this pillow for my pregnant daughter in law when she came to visit. When she left, I tried it. I have only used it 2 nights and this is the first time in over a year that I have not hurt during sleep and after. I was even able to sleep on my back (am normally a side sleeper) as the pillow "hugged" my sides and I bent the legs of it beneath my knees to relieve low back pressure. So comfy and comforting. I bought this one because the "legs" of it are longer than most of the others and I need support for my lower leg all the way down to my foot when sleeping on my side. I do bolster the head area with a small flat pillow, but will be going to the craft store to buy more filling. It is great without it though. I like that you can add more stuffing to suit your needs. Oh, and it did well for my pregnant daughter in law too. I am 5\'7". It is plenty long.'
b'Absolutely perfect. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s long enough to rest between both my knees and feet. That\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find. Yes my knees are bent a bit but nothing crazy. Who sleeps straight on their side anyway? This pillow has done wonders for my SI joint pain. I recently learned that sleeping on your side without a pillow between your knees really inflamed that joint and makes the pain worse. Now I sleep with this and have been pain free for two weeks. And it\xe2\x80\x99s great that I can hug it too. Or if I roll onto my back, I just put it under my knees to avoid angering that SI joint in that position. This pillow has worked miracles for me. My low back pain was ruining my life and now I am able to sleep so much better and I feel so much better in the morning. I also like that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to move the pillow if you turn over on the other side. And if you need a little support to lean you back against, works great for that too. Seriously worth the money. And it\xe2\x80\x99s very fluffy, took a couple days to fluff up fully like the little note from the company said. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more than full enough to be supportive. But it now!!'
b"I have slept with this since I got it. I have had 2 discectomy surgeries on my back, have residual pain and suffer from back tremors. With this pillow, I eliminated two side pillows, one for my feet, and one for my head. I still use one foam pillow, because I like my head more elevated when I sleep. I got the gray pillow, which is like a velure fabric. Honestly, would have loved this even more if the pillow case had been a jersey t-shirt knit, because it is very hot sometimes to sleep with. I will probably pick up a jersey sheet at a garage sale or thrift store to make one or two. I don't wake up as much at night in discomfort, toss and turn a lot less, and can position myself easier. My husband hates it, but admits I sleep better. We have a queen bed, so he thinks I take up too much room, but I feel it is still about half. This has saved me from begging my husband for new mattress, since ours is only about 5 years old and still good. I also wake up a lot less stiff in the morning, and almost no pain. I know these are supposed to be for pregnant women, but absolutely fabulous for people with back problems!"
b"It takes up a lot of room... even on a California King mattress but so worth it. I sleep like a baby on it. It can be molded and twisted to accommodate any sleeping or sitting position.  I wish I would have discovered this pillow when I had my mastectomy and I couldn't sleep in any position but on my back. It's kinda like a baby wedge to keep you from rolling over."
b'I was not sure about this pillow and I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure. It baffles me and for me maybe a miracle?!! I bought this pillow in hope that I might be able to stay in one position while sleeping. I have always been a problem sleeper (terrible) and actually injured my middle/upper back last August sitting up in the bed to flip over. I have no idea what it is like to sleep normal without constantly moving in my sleep, dreaming, wrestling something unknown. NOW is this new sleep I\xe2\x80\x99m experiencing normal? The pain in my back reoccurred several weeks ago. I was desperate to find something to keep me from moving about in my sleep. My back is feeling almost 100% and I wake up in the morning in the same position. It is so strange and unfamiliar for me to wake up not even being aware I was asleep or even in a bed. Sleep is now so empty and blank. I look so forward to going to bed to see if this is really real. Will I ever get used to this new normal? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if this is normal because I have never experienced it before. I know this probably makes no sense and yes I am dumbfounded. Sleep for me now has never felt so strange lol but I feel great! I LOVE THIS PILLOW!'
b"I am 67 with previous back surgery and 2 dislocated shoulders and lupus which makes your body ache all the time. But the worst was trying to find a position for sleeping at night.This has changed my life. I was going to purchase a new bed but after looking at beds for weeks I just didn't see much difference. Plus the prices on queen mattresses was overwhelming. So I researched these pillows after getting a pop up ad on another brand. After checking these out I chose this one because of the length and it was reviewed to be very bendable like a nest so you can wrap it around you, or stretch the bottom out to raise your knees,so I can use it for many positions. They said they would have covers coming out soon. You can take the outer cover off and wash it but don't put in dryer just hang to dry. I use a bottom sheet to wrap around it until I get a cover. Also if it doesn't have enough bulk for you it has a zipper that opens to add more stuffing if you want. Definitely the best and at this price could do better."
b'I searched and search and searched for a good pregnancy pillow to help with my chronic acid reflux. I saw so many reviews of other products where they has torn soon after purchase. I decided on this one, and couldn\'t be happier. The cover has held up well through washing and drying (but you do have to hang dry it)..My only "complaint" about this product (and it\'s a small and easily remidied one), is that if you are used to using a pillow between your knees to sleep on your side, this is just a bit too narrow. However, all you have to do is slip a pillow underneath it where your knees would be, and it\'s totally fine.'
b'I am not pregnant. I bought this to replace the four pillows that I usually use to support my back and hips. I need pillows on both sides because I am a side sleeper and need to switch sides a few times during the night. Verdict is...i love my new pillow! I still need to switch sides, but not as often. And because I no longer have to readjust all my pillows,  I barely wake up and easily go back to dreamland. Pillow keeps me nice and aligned. Perfect softness/firmness for my comfort.  I also love it for sitting up in the morning drinking coffee in bed and reading at night.'
b'Best purchase ever. I am 69 and obviously not pregnant. I bought it as an experiment to see if it could help me not roll onto my back because I snore and have sleep apnea when I do. It works really quite well \xe2\x80\x93 I use a snore monitoring app that shows that since using the pillow I have been snoring a lot less; I wake up feeling much more refreshed too. What I do is hug once side of the pillow and pull the other side close to my back. if I get too hot, I usually let go and then I will end up on my back again, so it is not a foolproof solution, but it is helping me delay getting a C-Pap machine. Highly recommended.'
b'This is a terrific product. I read all the reviews before I purchased one.  Yes, it certainly fills up the bed; yes, it makes things a bit warm--I bought one during the hot summer months in the south. And I can only wholeheartedly recommend it based on my experience!  No, I am not pregnant. I am a 70 year old woman with some aches and pains, and this pillow has revolutionized my sleeping experience and improved my morning aches better than any pill could! I would recommend one for anyone suffering from the same.  Only complaint -- I want a pillow case for the darned thing!'
b'I\'m not pregnant, but I bought this anyway. I have a bad back and could never get comfortable. That is until I purchased this U- shaped pillow. When my head is in the U area, the rest of it goes down to my ankles. I\'m 5\' 6". This pillow is so cuddly. No matter which way I lay, I feel like I\'m on a cloud. Since I\'ve gotten this, I sllep better than I have in over 15 years. It\'s amazing. My sister bought a V-shaped one. It was. Much shorter than mine, so we cut off a foot on each side of mine and I still have plenty of the pillow to wrap myself in.'
b'Bought this for my wife, who is not pregnant. She wanted a large pillow to wrap around her at night, shield herself from my tossing and turning at night, and to "cuddle" with when I am all cuddled out..... Needless to say she loves this pillow and now refers to it as her "boyfriend".'
b"I love this pillow! It is much longer than many I've seen and doesn't force you to sleep with your legs in a 45* angle to enjoy the snuggle comfort of it. It seemed very small when I took it out of the package but over two days it bulked up in size. I was not a fan of the cover however. It felt very scratchy and was not comfortable to sleep on. I took off the cover and was fine sleeping on the pillow itself. I contacted customer service to find out if there was an alternative case to purchase. I received a reply within 30 minutes stating they are 3 weeks out from new covers and would be willing to send me a new cover when they become available.  Now that is customer service! I will update once the new cover is received."
b'It provides added comfort to my bed. I would like to find another color  pillow case for it. I am happy with this purchase. I have had a lengthy illness and spend lots of time in bed, so this pillow was well worth the money.'
b"Buy some extra pillow stuffing as many have recommended.  This is definitely money well spent, but in about two months many of the key support points need some extra stuffing to perk it right up.  Simply unzip, take some foam stuffing and put a few handfuls and rearrange it to suit your comfort needs.  This pillow will continue to provide me with full body comfort for some time to come.  Oh, and for the first time it'll fill out to full size in a day or two, but you can still use it right out of the box."
b"Purchased s a gift for my pregnant wife to help her with a more restful sleep. It definitely works more often than not and seems to have reduced her snoring some as well. Fluffy and relatively firm for MY liking. Putting a pillow case on this beast is like trying to put clothes on a 10' snake. Overall, she loved her surprise; she's only without it when the pillowcase is in the wash."

b"I love this pillowcase.  And if u fanfold from zipper end to the open end, u have no problem putting this on your u shaped (even the long 20x130 uneven lenth ones.  I only have 1 hand that works and the other only thumb and pointer finger work. If  i can can easily by myself with minimal effort, with my hand restrictions, most people can. I dont get this wining about how hard it is to put on. And mine does fit. No idea why yours doesnt. I was skeptical if it would fit my u-shaped pregnancy/back pain pillow that is longer at one side, because of some reviews, but it did. Even with the waterproof matress cover i made into a pillowcase to protect it when i get my hot flashes, it still had extra room (circumference and length) after i zipped it up.  Yes, the pillowcase isn't all smooth at the u area and has creases, but it definately did not cause any discomfert.  As a matter of fact, I didnt even notice it when i was sleeping, not like the one that came with my pillow. That one had a flaw with the design because at the inside of the U curve it was super uncomfortable. It pulled really tight at the turns and left an area that was a little sharp, pokey and about to tear. This one does not have those problems and ill take the creases over those other problems anyday. Not to mention the \xe2\x80\x9cnone crease\xe2\x80\x9d ones are double the price ($40+).  I can buy 2 of these for 1 of those other ones, with out sacrificing quality of material or sewing. As a matter of fact, immediately after using these just 1 time, i bought 2 more and plan on ordering at least 2 more before im done. This is great pillowcase. You will not be disappointed, at least i wasnt.  I totally recomend this pillowcase.  Well, I've gotta go.  My body pillow is calling my name."
b'Bought this for our pregnant daughter who was having trouble getting comfortable sleeping. Not anymore she loves this thing!'
b'works well for me .'
b'Fits perfectly. Easy to out on. Good quality.'
b'Beautiful color. Fits my body pillow very well.'

b"I absolutely love this pillow! I had experienced trouble sleeping in the past, but once I got this pillow it completely changed. It helps me find a comfortable sleeping position quicker, so I can fall asleep faster. Also, I recently had surgery on my arm, which made sleeping even harder. This pillow really helps alleviate the pain by giving me many options for how to position my arm.Pros:-Soft jersey fabric-Perfect amount of fill-Many ways to use it-Improves sleeping-Makes lounging more comfortable-Well-made-Great customer serviceCons:-When I first opened it, it felt a little lumpy. This is because the pillow arrives vacuum sealed and needs a little time to let the air poof it back up. After using it for about an hour, the texture had completely changed and become extremely soft and poofy. So if it feels a little weird when you open it, give it time. This isn't even a con, just a reminder to be patient.In summary, this has been a complete game-changer for me. Who knew all that was standing between me and a good night's sleep was this body pillow? I am so glad to have this. It's seriously worth every penny. If you're on the fence, give this pillow a try. You're worth it. This purchase has made me so happy and grateful!"
b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I\xe2\x80\x99d like it when it first got here but I LOVE it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant. I did however just have a series of breast cancer surgeries that require me to sleep in my back. This thing has been a life saver. Thank you.'
b'I have had it about a month. I traveled for a week and was miserable without my "cuddle pillow" as I call it. I suffer from shoulder bursitis and this pillow worked miracles. My shoulder is getting better every day. My only complaint would be the cover wasn\'t offered in different colors. The grey doesn\'t match my color scheme. I plan on buying more for relatives for Christmas!'
b'This is the third full body pregnancy pillow I have bought.  In my opinion, everyone should get one.  They really help you sleep better.  Compared to the other two I bought this one is even softer on the face so my wife kind of commandeered it.  Men, if you are getting it for yourself you should just buy two - you wife will end up with the first one for sure.'
b'I was having the worst back pain for months and nothing was helping. I bought this suspecting that I may be tossing and turning in my sleep and my back felt way better after sleeping with it for a few weeks. Its like my own personal nest, I think this must be how baby kangaroos feel in their mothers pouch.'
b"Perfect for anyone with back or knee pain. Really helps with a good night's sleep."
b'My husband has back pain so I bought this pillow for him and he loved it.'
b'Awesome pillow for pregnant women'
b'Love love love it!! So helpful with back pain, knee pain, big belly issues.'
b'Nice colors a little bigger then I thought'

b'Pros: 1. Long enough (I\'m 5\' 4")  2. Cured back, hip and leg pain within a few days. I believe my chronic pain was caused by the fact that I sleep on my right side and my left leg had no support. 3. Don\'t need to be pregnant  4. Supports whole body - one side between the legs and the other side snugly propped against your back  5. Don\'t need pillow - it\'s very comfortable to rest your head on the top curve. 6. Cover washes easily - good idea to order an extra cover and alternat them. 7. Thick and firm enough to support body. 8. Head rest provides support and enough height to give your shoulder some room.Cons: 2. As a post - menopausal woman whose body still runs warm, I sweat being surrounded by this pillow (due to the synthetic filling). For me the benefits outweight this. I drape a towel on the headrest to protect the pillow. 3. Big and cumbersome - can\'t avoid an unsightly lump under the comforter when you make your bed for the day.'
b"I enjoy this pillow so much! I am 13 weeks pregnant and even though my stomach isn't that big yet it is very supportive. We have a queen size bed, it takes up my half the bad but my husband usually ends up with his head on it as well. I do not have shove pillows behind me anymore because this has all the support I need. Front support nack support and head support!"
b'Good body support!!! I purchased 2 one for my husband and myself. My husband who is a trucker deals with aches and pain on daily basis never able to sleep in, this is day 3 my husband calles his body pillow his cocoon and can\'t wait to crawl in to it. In the 3 days we owned our pillow he doesn\'t feel all the body aches as he is used to,he was in total shock when he actually slept in until 9 in the morning.  We own a Queen size bed and 2 of the medium size body pillows fit perfect on it. My Husband is 5"10 and weights 220lb and the medium body pillow is perfect for him. I guess this body pillow is not just for pregnant people, but also for people that need more body support to help with aches and pain. People ask how do you stor those giant pillows, I place them on a heavy duty clothing hanger and hang them in our closet.'
b"One of the best purchases I've ever made. This pillow is SO comfortable and supportive. I'm not pregnant; it was purchased because I have sleeping problems and often can't get comfortable. This was a game changer. I sleep so much better now!PROS:The quality is very good. I read so many reviews of similar pillows before purchasing, and was nervous it would be flat and limp/poor quality. Not the case! Very full. The arms can be arranged in all kinds of positions, there are no end to the possibilities of how to get comfy with this thing. I put the arms under my legs while sitting up and reading or watching TV in bed. Feels like floating on a cloud! I'm a stomach/side sleeper, and before this pillow, my arms were falling asleep while on my stomach. This totally solved that. My shoulders, neck and arms are so much more comfortable now.CONS: I washed the pillow case and it won't fit on the pillow now (cold wash/air dry, did not put n the dryer). So I'm using it without it, which is not ideal. I'm very good at removing my makeup before bed, but you still sweat, etc in your sleep and it's not hygienic to sleep on a pillow for too long without washing. I am reluctant to throw the whole thing in the washer, but I don't think I have a choice. Hopefully it doesn't ruin it.This thing is not small! We have a queen size bed, and thankfully I have an understanding husband, but it definitely takes up a generous portion of the space we have. Add a small/medium size dog that lis a bed hog and loves to cuddle in bed with us, and it's really a tight fit these days! My husband gets a little less real estate on the bed now, and I feel badly, but the benefits outweigh my guilt! Haha. I'll be using it until he tells me he's had enough :)Lastly, it's hard to store. We don't have a bedroom closet (old house problems!) so it gets shoved under the bed when company comes over. Again, with no pillow case on it now....that is less than ideal. Not the pillow's fault, just something to note if you're tight on bedroom storage as we are."
b'I have been using this body pillow for around 4 weeks now. It has honestly done wonders for my back during pregnancy. I started to use it when I was 26 weeks pregnant, and am now almost 31 weeks. Before I used the Meiz U Shaped pillow I was waking up sore every morning. My back would ache for quite awhile when I would get out of bed after being unable to find comfortable sleeping positions during the night. I was rarely getting a good night\'s sleep and then was waking up feeling like I had been run over. This pillow has been a miracle worker for me in regards to improving all of those issues. I rarely wake up sore anymore!!I\'m 5\'0" and 110 lbs pre pregnancy (short and petite) for those wanting size references. The pillow feels like the perfect size for me, so I\'m really not sure this pillow would work for someone who is really tall.'
b"My sister in law is pregnant so her tummy is getting bigger and bigger! She complained that she couldn't sleep good and having back pain during the night! I shopped around and finally bought this maternity pillow for her. After that, she treated me a nice lunch because she appreciated my help for looking a right pillow for her and now she has no more complain about her sleeping and backache after I bought her the pillow!"
b"I read a lot of reviews for many pillows as I searched for a good U-shaped maternity pillow. I ended up with this one because of the average good reviews and the price. I'm extremely happy with it. The stuffing holds up well and I love how I can toss and turn all night and not have to move the pillow because of it's shape. It provides a lot of support for my whole body, especially taking pressure off my lower back with it being between my knees. I'm glad I went with this product and would definently recommend the purchase to anyone else."
b"my mom bought this pillow for me bc i've been having issues sleeping alone. it's super fluffy and comfy!!!! after she ordered it, i read some of the reviews and i'm confused as to why it got negative ones.bless this pillow. i see sleep in my future."
b'I also bought this pillow for body aches, not pregnancy.  It\'s has high quality materials and construction.  The filling has a soft, zippered material.  I easily removed some filler from the pillow to my suit my preference.  Wish these had been available when I was having my children.  It\'s cozy and versatile.  Would love to get one for my 6\'3" son if came in a longer size for tall women and men.  The grey velvet cover is crazy soft and plush.  My little granddaughter loves sleeping in the cozy nest it creates.  Enjoy!'
b"I bought 2 one was a gift!! When I purchased these I  was worried about the thickness and  what it was filled with I have the larger size....It is well worth every penny!! not to thick and not to thin,,, It's perfect I was worried because some people were posting pics that was showing the pillow ripping I can see some sensitivity there but I have not experienced any issues... bought these because I we can't sleep at night due to pain... I am not pregnant... and either the one I gave it too, She 74 years old and has found some relief from her arthritis it also helps her to sit and watch her movies at night... Perfect addition to your bedroom... Only wish it came with an extra pillow case"

b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any cons to this item. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x995 26 and 6 months pregnant and before this pillow I had persisting back pain that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. I wake up rested and it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice and snuggly. My husband may hate the fact that it ends up on his side of the bed but oh well I need to sleep lol. And this is the item that pregnant women need to invest in!! It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect amount of soft and firm. And it helps keep me in pleasant dream land instead of the land of strange dreams, which I have with the pains. But honestly with the help of this pillow I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to continue to take Tylenol every night. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a major goal. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99ll be helpful even after pregnancy too because I\xe2\x80\x99ve already put my pillows in the storage closet for safe keeping. This is the only pillow I need \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f.'
b"I love this pillow! It's changed my life. I don't think I've slept this soundly since my mother was pregnant with me. It's big and comfy and doesn't get hot at night.But the pillow case! It's a struggle to put that thing back on. I think next time I might just wash the pillow with the pillow case on to save myself the aggravation."
b"Wow. This is so comfortable. I deal with chronic illness & this is actually comforting some how. I feel surrounded & supported. I'm 5'9 & got the xtra long one & glad I did. I can fold it under my knees for back support. ALSO this one is not a HOT material. It is a cool cotton type. Some of them are fleece-type. Thankfully this gray one is not. Stays cool. Highly recommend :). Especially if a person needs a little comfort."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 23 weeks pregnant, and I got this pillow two or three months ago, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using it for a while. I was struggling to sleep so much, even earlier in my pregnancy. At first when I slept with the u portion of the pillow under my head, it would bother my shoulders, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough room for them and it would just keep me up because I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up every time I needed to reposition myself. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t helping me sleep more at that point.But, I flipped it and use my own pillow now. I can spread the longer ends out if I need a little more room and I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the support I need between my knees and arms. Though I still wake up throughout the night because I have to use the bathroom, this pillow has become a must for me, and I may not switch back to just my normal pillow after I have the baby!'
b'Finding a body pillow, especially when pregnant, can be tough. After reading a ton of reviews, I settled on this one. I haven\'t regretted it for a second. It\'s firm , but not too firm. It\'s soft, but does not make me overheat. The cover is removable and washable (air dry only!). I prefer my usual pillow, so I just turned this pill upside down and put the "top" part between my ankles for extra comfort. I can roll back and forth all night (which I often do since I\'m not a side sleeper, however pregnancy removes that choice), and not have to drag a regular body pillow back and forth. When I\'m resting in bed but not sleeping, it makes a great back support with arms that wrap around like a little shelf for my laptop or ipad.  I will probably never stop using this pillow, long after the baby is born.'
b'I gave a gift. The recipient called to say she was thrilled with the gift. After opening and using it, it was so much better than she expected and LOVES IT!! She says she has been using it everyday and is great for aligning back, sitting in bed reading and relieving belly stress (is pregnant). She is a massage therapist and says she is going to recommend this pillow for her client with back issues.'
b"I bought this for my second pregnancy, because the pretzel shaped body pillow I used in my first pregnancy was too complicated to rearrange in the middle of the night.  This U shaped pillow is CRAZY comfortable and supportive.  I am a back sleeper, and I dreaded the 5-month requirement to sleep on my side again.  This pillow acts as a pillow for your head, a backrest, and a pillow to support your belly and go between your knees.  It's wonderful, and I've slept wonderfully in it for weeks.  It comes with a cover that--I'm not going to lie--is kind of hard to wrestle on and off.  But other than that I would recommend this to every pregnant woman I know.  When you add another pillow to the top of the back of it, it's also really great for reading in bed."
b'my favorite, after my hysterectomy recovery time and now, I have been using this to support my tummy and back , I\'m side sleeper and this helps elevate my feet.  before this I had to go with 4 pillows in total to do the same and when you need to go rest room in the middle of the night right after surgery, it was a pain to move the pillows and get up (weak stomach muscles ) and if the pillows fall down, you can\'t bend to pick them up and have to wake someone up and disturb them.... now you just move/push away the side and just pull it anywhere and good to go.  I\'m 5.2" and comes almost at my ankle when in side sleeping with bent legs.I washed it too it holds the shape and cover is good quality too.'
b"OMG....I don't know how I survived without one. Definitely not just for pregnant women. I am male and recently had a wrist injury, so sleeping was getting to be difficult hence this purchase. From the first nite I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in.I am also a CPAP user and find this to be an awesome pillow that allows support without creating a lot of pressure on the face mask.All in all a double win for me. Oh yeah, back pain is also less since using this."

b"I first had the Snoogle Jersey Knit pillow, which was comfortable, but it's quite firm and enormous. Hubby and I have a king size bed, so I was ok with the size. However, after using the Snoogle I had a stiff neck, and you can't use your own head pillows. I love my head pillows, so this was a major problem. Snoogle went back to the store.I happyily discovered the Boppy Pregnancy Support Pillow and haven't regretted my decision! This pillow is a perfect size, I can bring it in the living room, den, where ever! You can even take in on road trips or vacay! The cover is soft, machine washable, and fashionable.There are endless ways to lay with this support pillow. I don't have anything negative to say about it! Enjoy ladies!Also, my hubby and dog love the pillow as well."
b"I'm in love with this pillow!I tried one of the other brands, that wraps all the way around the body. It was hard, and the pillow was covered in a cheap material. I returned it and ordered this one because I've heard great things about Boppy. I wasn't disappointed!The pillow is made of cotton and the pillow case is cotton jersey (like t-shirt material). So soft! I love that both pillow and case are machine washable.The pillow itself is soft and squishy but still supportive. The little comma tail stayed between my legs when I rolled over in the night.Last night was the best sleep I've gotten in about 3 months. I would recommend to any pregnant lady!"
b"Perfect for those hard-to-sleep nights!  Which is every night right now.  I'm 32 weeks pregnant with my second and this pillow has been a lifesaver.  I bought a Snoogle initially, but trying to maneuver myself and that huge thing every time I had to roll over was ridiculous.  This one is small enough to easily move with me as I awkwardly roll over.  I alternate between using the big and little ends between my legs.  The big end is a bit fuller, so gives my hips a little more support."
b"I absolutely love this pillow and it's been such a relief for sleeping. I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant and I got this about a week and a half ago. Now that I'm getting bigger, I need the hip support and I like that the larger end fits comfortably under my bump as well.  Previously I had been using a regular bed pillow but the Boppy is by far a much better support pillow. Fast shipping so I ordered it the Monday before Thanksgiving and it arrived on Black Friday. I like that this pregnancy pillow doesn't take up a lot of space because most of the pillows you see are massive and take up most of the bed and my poor husband would have no space whatsoever. I like that I can also use this pillow when sitting on the couch for back support. It's firm yet soft at the same time. The only issue I have is my yorkie trying to take naps on it!"
b"This pillow has been a savior for me during my pregnancy! I didn't like the large pregnancy pillows that wrap around the whole body as I felt they were very overwhelming and hard to flip from side to side in middle of the night without waking up the whole neighborhood. I decided to try this pillow and it has worked so well! I change sides a million times every night and it is so much easier to flip over in the middle of the night without getting tangled in blankets and a giant pregnancy pillow. I also like being able to place this pillow in different areas that I feel I need a little extra support!"
b'My son was in the NICU after being born and I first tried this pillow while in the hospital. I loves it!! I love that it\xe2\x80\x99s a larger pillow than the average Boppy. It\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable to breastfeed and wraps around your entire waist. The pillow is nicely stuffed, soft , and has a luxurious feel to it. It comes with a beautiful cover that is easily removed if you would like to wash it. I placed an additional pillow cover to protect it. Nothing on the package said nursing pillow, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best one out there. Prior to this pillow I purchased another one similar to the popular small Boppy pillows and it was cheaply made, too small, and the stuffing was extemely hard and uncomfortable. Better to buy this one instead. Worth every penny. I love this pillow!!! This is the best nirsing pillow and the price is terriffic!!!I promose you won\xe2\x80\x99t be dissapointed.'
b"I love this pillow, its perfect for me. Not too big and so easy to throw in the wash to fluff back up when it starts to get flattened out from use. I am currently 25 weeks pregnant and bought this around 16 weeks. Normally I sleep on my back but during pregnancy it's better to sleep on your side and it felt way too uncomfortable for me until I got this pillow. Also my back started hurting very early on too, and this was such a life saver. I don't think I'd be able to sleep without this pillow right now."
b'I purchased this pillow at the beginning of my second pregnancy and used it every night as it was a huge comfort for me. During my first pregnancy I had the \xe2\x80\x9csnoogle\xe2\x80\x9d and thought it was ridiculous. It was like having another person in the bed with my husband and I!  A little overkill in my opinion\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m only 5\xe2\x80\x99 tall! The boppy is well designed and perfect for wedging between your legs, relieving back pain. It also helped towards the end of my pregnancy to rest my growing bump. I also used it on top of my king sized pillows to elevate my head and body when I was snoring like a bear and really uncomfortable. This pillow came full circle. I brought it to the hospital with me, used it to aid in breast feeding my new baby, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I want to part with it postpartum. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great pillow and a great buy in my opinion!'
b"Around 10 weeks into pregnancy, I started suffering from back pain, and I read keeping a pillow between your legs helped. I researched the best pregnancy pillow and bought one of those huge U-shaped ones. I didn't like the pillow being so close to my chest, but it did help with the hip alignment (as did a chiropractor). As my bump began to grow, I realized those U-shaped pillows did not provide any belly support. I had a huge pillow that was really only providing leg support and providing too much pillow where I did not want it. I purchased this comma-shaped pillow and it has been providing great belly and between the leg support, and I can use my regular head pillow. It's small enough that I can use it on the couch, too. I do wish there was more padding between the legs, but I can stuff it with more material if I really need to. I also use a wedge pillow for below my hip and for when I turn. It's much nicer having two small pillows than the monster one. I recommend this for those stomach/side sleepers out there!"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant nor planning on it anytime soon. But I changed my sleeping positions in recent months I noticed and this is exactly what I needed. I also lost some weight and sleeping on my side made my knees knock and this again is a perfect solution without knee pillows which are bulky and awkward. It\xe2\x80\x99s cool to touch and just a perfect shape and size ! So comfortable and helps me sleep my best !'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 20 weeks pregnant with baby #2. For my first pregnancy I had a pillow that took up most of the bed and I loved it, however, my husband did not! \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 This pillow is the best compromise! My hips feel supported, my tailbone has stopped aching, I love how soft it is and the removable cover is super cute! As you can see, my senior dog loves it too!'
b"I love this pillow. It's not too hard or soft. It's the perfect size. The covering is also really soft. A lot of the other maternity pillows were simply too big and hard for me to sleep on but I was extremely comfortable the first night with this. I can't sleep without it."
b'This was recommended by a friend who got the pillow during her pregnancy then used for nursing. She liked it because she thought it was softer and more comfortable than the other Boppy and nursing pillows she tried. Her son, now 2, still uses and loves it. So far I love it too. I\xe2\x80\x99m six months pregnant and it really helps at night. Would def recommend.'
b'The best pregnancy pillow out there! I have tried so many other options that were terrible (too big, too hard or too soft). This one is the perfect size, and light enough to easily change your sleeping side during the night, and it is the perfect amount of support and softness! I only wish I had found this one sooner!'
b"I bought this 4 months ago and I have a month left before delivery (or so we hope!).  This pillow has been my saving grace for sleep, I can't recommend it enough.  My friend gave me her wedge and this with the wedge allow me to sleep as comfortably as possible without waking up on my back.  When I don't use this pillow, I almost always wake up on my back and end up with sore hips.  The shape allows me to use it in many different ways depending on where I feel sore or where I could use more support.  It really works!"
b'This is the perfect pillow to ease my back pain while not kicking my husband out of the bed! The large pregnancy pillows are just not reasonable with two people in one bed, and the one that I have (a snoogle?) is too firm for me. This pillow is perfectly soft and easy to move around to different positions.'
b'Love this pillow. Have used a full size body pillow in the past and much prefer this size. Happy I ordered in my early second trimester because being 19 weeks today I cannot imagine sleeping without it. Very comfortable, light eight, supporting, and can easily switch sides in my sleep without a hassle.'
b'I love this pillow! We have a queen bed and so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to purchase a big bulky pillow while I was pregnant but i needed something to help me sleep. This pillow saved my life. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great size for those who want something smaller than the average maternity pillow. Plus I use it to breastfeed now! I bought this pillow 4 months before our little one came and it held up and still works great as a nursing pillow. My baby even loves to lay on my lap with the pillow engulfing her. Overall It\xe2\x80\x99s a great pillow. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend it to anyone.'
b'I had one before and left it at an hotel so I bought it again. Perfect for relieving hip aches while cradling an increasingly heavy tummy. Easier to manage than the big pillows. And super soft.'
b"Much more convenient for me than the larger lounge type support pillows. I use this every single night (pregnant!) and it works perfectly for a variety of sleeping positions. It has a soft cover and isn't too firm."

b'Not pregnant. This is for my 260lb boyfriend / bear - he loves it. I was tasked to find a body pillow which had same day shipping (in my area). I also don\xe2\x80\x99t support anything made from animals, so I was looking for synthetic fills only. This pillow does the job. In 90 years, if and when we decide to have children, this pillow may also be useful. It also helps that this comes with its\xe2\x80\x99 own pillowcase, rather than a conventional body pillow... which, from perusing Amazon, it seems as if the pillowcases are sold separately.As this was the only item in our order, the pillow came in it\xe2\x80\x99s original box. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it another way as sometimes Amazon over-boxes some items quite wastefully... however... on the box, it says:\xe2\x80\x9c....PREGNANCY PILLOW...\xe2\x80\x9dImagine the look on my boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s face when receiving the package. She almost denied delivery! \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
b'First night was perfect for me, and my wife which is hard to believe. We woke up , and it was light outside which is unbelievable. I snore so I\'ve had my own room for years, so for both of us to sleep sound for the first time all night in a long long is a credit to these new pillows. Amazon came thru again with this pillow, and I say "It\'s a steal not a deal" at any price. I bought them as a lead up gift for our 42nd anniversary, and it might just be the best gift of all for us. LOL Thank you Prime.'
b"These two pillows, I bought was for my guest bed, it seems like a good product for secondary use. When I opened them, they seem to surprise me by how well crafted the products are. They are soft enough and yet durable enough for everyday use. You know, how you hate it when some pillows just don't fit your pillow cases well. They don't come with that factory smell, and they are air-seal for packaging, which I personally love. Overall, they are pillows I might even consider to use for myself. They are easy to fluff up and the edges on the pillows are as good as those at any upscale hotels. My recommendation is to use the zippered or sealed pillow case, which can engulf the entire pillow. This way, I think they would be more comfortable. I finally find some great pillows unlike all these crazy infomercial or high price brand name ones."
b'Fast shipping and a very nice product.'
b'Love these pillows, soft yet not giant puffy balls. They retain their shape and are just the perfect size and feel in my opinion.'
b'Really comfortable pillows'
b'I left it out all day and evening and it did not loft up like the picture. At bedtime i put a protector on my pillows and satin cases. They are so big i used one as body pillow and slept with other. I had a good sleep and woke up refreshed. The pillows helped with some bone problems i have. They are very nice and pretty for 29.99. I think they were a steal.in addition one pillow lofted to the correct height and one has not.i love these pillows even though one of them did not reach full loft. I wish it had. I would have loved them even more. I allowed them to loft anvaddiyiobal 2 days and nights and couldn"t be more satisfied. Thank you'
b'Most amazing pillow I have slept on in my 60yrs! Molds to you. Yet semi firm. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go flat. So impressed with it I purchased the standard size same day.'
b'Very comfortable. I am pleased with the quality'
b"Nice firm pillow. It holds it's shape."
b'They look exactly as how they described. As a side sleeper, they give me enough height and firmness to support my head.'
b'I bought these for my husband as he is not as picky as me and a more expensive memory foam pillow for myself. I was glad there were two of these they are much nicer then I expected and traded mine out for this.'
b"Great pillows and in fact I'm going to order two more!"
b"It's great as the other products. Very comfortable. I love it."
b'Love these pillows.  They are exactly what I had hoped they would be.'
b'Very nice pillows. They are somewhat large, but not so big as to be uncomfortable. Made well, and very comfortable.'
b'These pillows are great. Came sooner than expected. Filled pillow covers perfectly! Love these pillows.'
b'Being in my third trimester, I would wake up every morning with horrible back pain. After only one night of using this pillow, I woke up with no back pain! I was so comfortable all night and woke up well rested. Very pleased, so worth it!!'
b'nice'
b'Great pillows! Unfortunately my dog loved them more and destroyed them.'

b"I am currently 5 months pregnant and was beginning to get uncomfortable sleeping. I desperately wanted a body pillow that would support my changing body. This pillow is wonderful! As soon as I took it out of the box it fluffed up perfectly. It wasn't lumpy or uneven. The cover is a nice color and soft. I love that I am able to remove it to wash it when I need to. It is just the right size and doesn't feel too full. If it were any more full it would be to much and and any less wouldn't be enough. I find that I sleep much more comfortably now that I have this pillow! I would highly recommend this pillow! It's a great buy for the price! My husband even likes it so much he wants to buy one for himself!"
b"I wanted to write this review right after I got this but also wanted to use it a few days to give a good review.. I am not pregnant just chubby and like to flop around a lot but also sleep on my belly.. this pillow.. oh my goodness! I can't say enough for how great this thing is.. pregnant or chubby GET THIS THING!!"
b"i ended up buying something similar (for twice the price) during my first pregnancy and fell in love with it, and had to get another when i found out we were expecting our second child.  this pillow is pretty much exactly the same as the first one except cheaper but works just as well.  i love that the pillow wraps all the way around you so you don't have to constantly flip it around while trying to get comfortable during the night.  this is worth every penny and have recommended it to every pregnant friend i can!"
b"Very cozy and length is just right.I'd put a fleece blanket over the top where neck and head are to protect from scalp/skin oil and sweat.  Though, the cover can be washed, those smells remain in the pillow stuffing and don't come out.Great for sciatica n sacral lumbar pain with keeping the spine straight. Keep pillow between thighs while on side.Helps with GERD n regurgitation issues.Not just for women n pregnancy. I give it 2 \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d up ."
b"I've got a bad back/hips/shoulders/knees and I'm a side sleeper. I love oregnancy pillows for the extra support. I've used several. This one is definitely the most comfortable and the plushest. Lots of pillows are just jam packed with cheap cotton and feel hard. This one is like the best pillow, but massive."
b"My daughter which is  pregnant with twins says this pregnancy pillow maternity is amazing.  I am so glad we got it.  She can now rest better and is much more comfortable.  Very high quality and much needed. She just removes the cover to wash it when she needs to. It is just the right size and doesn't feel too full. If it were any more full it would be to much and and any less wouldn't be enough....its just right.  She sleeps much more comfortably now that She has this pillow! I would highly recommend this pillow! It's a great buy for the price"
b'Bought this for my wife who was 4 months pregnant at the time.  She absolutely loves this pillow.  It made a difference in her comfort level and allowed her to sleep better from night one.  I highly recommend this to any mother to be who is having problems sleeping.  It has made a huge difference for my wife, and I am very appreciative for that.'
b'Amazing and comfortable! I got the brown pillow I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 12 weeks, I will be buying severeal  different pillows, this is the first maternity pillow I\xe2\x80\x99ve bought and it\xe2\x80\x99s soft, comfortable, and firm all at the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty big pillow on my queen size bed but luckily I sleep alone! \xf0\x9f\x92\x81\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbe\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f A must buy in my book!'
b"I absolutely love this pillow and could definitely not get through this pregnancy without it. My first pregnancy I was miserable and had to use all sorts of pillows to prop my legs up and then to prop my back and then another for my head, just to have to roll over and start the whole pillow propping process again. I was disappointed that after only a month of having it, the cover's zipper broke, but I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement. WHAT GREAT SERVICE!!!!"
b'This pillow has saved me. I will recommend this for anyone - pregnant or not! It hugs you all night long.I bought at around 20 weeks pregnant, and am now 27 weeks. I was having a hard time going to sleep on my side and staying there (kept waking up on my back) until I discovered this pillow. Bravo! Now, aside from the bathroom trips, I can sleep the rest of the night long!*Only drawback: After delicately washing and tumble drying the cover, the zipper broke, so I had to purchase a new cover.'
b"I love this pillow!!!! I've always had to use a mommie pillow during my pregnancies. I saw a simular pillow posted on Facebook, but I ran across this particular one during my search. This one was just as nice, but the price was right $55.99. Most of the others started at $89 - $100 and more. If I were to complain, it would only be that I wish there was just a little more cushion in the head part, why, because I still use my regular pill with it for watching TV and going to sleep. I will attach a pic of my old mommie pillow, which I paid $89 for 6yrs ago, and a picture of this one."
b'At 5 months pregnant, this is great for sleep and sore joints. The shape is excellent and the padding soft yet supportive. Wish the fabric was less rough though as it makes my face a little sensitive'
b'The product is not as firm as I would have liked. I need something more supportive for my back. Otherwise it would be fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s a personal preference and based on needs for your body. I received the product timely and have been in touch with the seller who has been very kind about my concerns.'
b"wife loved it and now that she doesnt need it anymore I'll admit that i have been putting to good use. I use it all the time"
b"I'm pregnant with twins and started having really bad back pain at 12 weeks, so I invested in this pillow. BEST PURCHASE EVER. Now I can actually sleep (in any position) and comfortably! It's so great, I named it flubber!P.S. I do get a little too warm when using it under my covers. Other than that, absolutely no cons :)"
b'Got this for my sister last year because she was high risk pregnancy and on bed rest. She was always in pain this certainly made her comfortable and less than twice the price for most than I found. The kids certainly loved it as well'
b'My wife is pregnant and this pillow has allowed her to sleep comfortably again. I bought this as a surprise for her and she says it\xe2\x80\x99s the best gift she\xe2\x80\x99s received. It supports her belly and has eased the pain she was having in her hips.'
b'amazing!!!! i had a different maternity pillow with my first pregnancy and i didnt like it and now that im pregnant with twins n decided to try this one out since i was unable to find comfort in bed and let me tell you i loveeeeee it its perfectt!  cannot sleep without it !'
b'If you are on the fence about buying this... Click buy now!!! It has been wonderful for this pregnant lady!!! I sleep so much better now. My husband is not a fan of the size of the pillow but he puts up with it because of how much it helps my sleep.'
b'It is such a great pillow.  I am sleeping better.'

b'Pros: 1. Long enough (I\'m 5\' 4")  2. Cured back, hip and leg pain within a few days. I believe my chronic pain was caused by the fact that I sleep on my right side and my left leg had no support. 3. Don\'t need to be pregnant  4. Supports whole body - one side between the legs and the other side snugly propped against your back  5. Don\'t need pillow - it\'s very comfortable to rest your head on the top curve. 6. Cover washes easily - good idea to order an extra cover and alternat them. 7. Thick and firm enough to support body. 8. Head rest provides support and enough height to give your shoulder some room.Cons: 2. As a post - menopausal woman whose body still runs warm, I sweat being surrounded by this pillow (due to the synthetic filling). For me the benefits outweight this. I drape a towel on the headrest to protect the pillow. 3. Big and cumbersome - can\'t avoid an unsightly lump under the comforter when you make your bed for the day.'
b"I enjoy this pillow so much! I am 13 weeks pregnant and even though my stomach isn't that big yet it is very supportive. We have a queen size bed, it takes up my half the bad but my husband usually ends up with his head on it as well. I do not have shove pillows behind me anymore because this has all the support I need. Front support nack support and head support!"
b'Good body support!!! I purchased 2 one for my husband and myself. My husband who is a trucker deals with aches and pain on daily basis never able to sleep in, this is day 3 my husband calles his body pillow his cocoon and can\'t wait to crawl in to it. In the 3 days we owned our pillow he doesn\'t feel all the body aches as he is used to,he was in total shock when he actually slept in until 9 in the morning.  We own a Queen size bed and 2 of the medium size body pillows fit perfect on it. My Husband is 5"10 and weights 220lb and the medium body pillow is perfect for him. I guess this body pillow is not just for pregnant people, but also for people that need more body support to help with aches and pain. People ask how do you stor those giant pillows, I place them on a heavy duty clothing hanger and hang them in our closet.'
b"One of the best purchases I've ever made. This pillow is SO comfortable and supportive. I'm not pregnant; it was purchased because I have sleeping problems and often can't get comfortable. This was a game changer. I sleep so much better now!PROS:The quality is very good. I read so many reviews of similar pillows before purchasing, and was nervous it would be flat and limp/poor quality. Not the case! Very full. The arms can be arranged in all kinds of positions, there are no end to the possibilities of how to get comfy with this thing. I put the arms under my legs while sitting up and reading or watching TV in bed. Feels like floating on a cloud! I'm a stomach/side sleeper, and before this pillow, my arms were falling asleep while on my stomach. This totally solved that. My shoulders, neck and arms are so much more comfortable now.CONS: I washed the pillow case and it won't fit on the pillow now (cold wash/air dry, did not put n the dryer). So I'm using it without it, which is not ideal. I'm very good at removing my makeup before bed, but you still sweat, etc in your sleep and it's not hygienic to sleep on a pillow for too long without washing. I am reluctant to throw the whole thing in the washer, but I don't think I have a choice. Hopefully it doesn't ruin it.This thing is not small! We have a queen size bed, and thankfully I have an understanding husband, but it definitely takes up a generous portion of the space we have. Add a small/medium size dog that lis a bed hog and loves to cuddle in bed with us, and it's really a tight fit these days! My husband gets a little less real estate on the bed now, and I feel badly, but the benefits outweigh my guilt! Haha. I'll be using it until he tells me he's had enough :)Lastly, it's hard to store. We don't have a bedroom closet (old house problems!) so it gets shoved under the bed when company comes over. Again, with no pillow case on it now....that is less than ideal. Not the pillow's fault, just something to note if you're tight on bedroom storage as we are."
b'Great Item. Well Made and sturdy. The pillow depth and consistency is very good, well padded and will give a lot of support. Like the pink/blue option, by simply flipping the support. Larger than I expected, which is good. I highly recommend purchasing this.'
b'I have been using this body pillow for around 4 weeks now. It has honestly done wonders for my back during pregnancy. I started to use it when I was 26 weeks pregnant, and am now almost 31 weeks. Before I used the Meiz U Shaped pillow I was waking up sore every morning. My back would ache for quite awhile when I would get out of bed after being unable to find comfortable sleeping positions during the night. I was rarely getting a good night\'s sleep and then was waking up feeling like I had been run over. This pillow has been a miracle worker for me in regards to improving all of those issues. I rarely wake up sore anymore!!I\'m 5\'0" and 110 lbs pre pregnancy (short and petite) for those wanting size references. The pillow feels like the perfect size for me, so I\'m really not sure this pillow would work for someone who is really tall.'
b"My sister in law is pregnant so her tummy is getting bigger and bigger! She complained that she couldn't sleep good and having back pain during the night! I shopped around and finally bought this maternity pillow for her. After that, she treated me a nice lunch because she appreciated my help for looking a right pillow for her and now she has no more complain about her sleeping and backache after I bought her the pillow!"
b"I read a lot of reviews for many pillows as I searched for a good U-shaped maternity pillow. I ended up with this one because of the average good reviews and the price. I'm extremely happy with it. The stuffing holds up well and I love how I can toss and turn all night and not have to move the pillow because of it's shape. It provides a lot of support for my whole body, especially taking pressure off my lower back with it being between my knees. I'm glad I went with this product and would definently recommend the purchase to anyone else."
b"my mom bought this pillow for me bc i've been having issues sleeping alone. it's super fluffy and comfy!!!! after she ordered it, i read some of the reviews and i'm confused as to why it got negative ones.bless this pillow. i see sleep in my future."
b'I also bought this pillow for body aches, not pregnancy.  It\'s has high quality materials and construction.  The filling has a soft, zippered material.  I easily removed some filler from the pillow to my suit my preference.  Wish these had been available when I was having my children.  It\'s cozy and versatile.  Would love to get one for my 6\'3" son if came in a longer size for tall women and men.  The grey velvet cover is crazy soft and plush.  My little granddaughter loves sleeping in the cozy nest it creates.  Enjoy!'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any cons to this item. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x995 26 and 6 months pregnant and before this pillow I had persisting back pain that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. I wake up rested and it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice and snuggly. My husband may hate the fact that it ends up on his side of the bed but oh well I need to sleep lol. And this is the item that pregnant women need to invest in!! It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect amount of soft and firm. And it helps keep me in pleasant dream land instead of the land of strange dreams, which I have with the pains. But honestly with the help of this pillow I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to continue to take Tylenol every night. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a major goal. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99ll be helpful even after pregnancy too because I\xe2\x80\x99ve already put my pillows in the storage closet for safe keeping. This is the only pillow I need \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f.'
b"I love this pillow! It's changed my life. I don't think I've slept this soundly since my mother was pregnant with me. It's big and comfy and doesn't get hot at night.But the pillow case! It's a struggle to put that thing back on. I think next time I might just wash the pillow with the pillow case on to save myself the aggravation."
b"Wow. This is so comfortable. I deal with chronic illness & this is actually comforting some how. I feel surrounded & supported. I'm 5'9 & got the xtra long one & glad I did. I can fold it under my knees for back support. ALSO this one is not a HOT material. It is a cool cotton type. Some of them are fleece-type. Thankfully this gray one is not. Stays cool. Highly recommend :). Especially if a person needs a little comfort."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 23 weeks pregnant, and I got this pillow two or three months ago, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using it for a while. I was struggling to sleep so much, even earlier in my pregnancy. At first when I slept with the u portion of the pillow under my head, it would bother my shoulders, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough room for them and it would just keep me up because I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up every time I needed to reposition myself. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t helping me sleep more at that point.But, I flipped it and use my own pillow now. I can spread the longer ends out if I need a little more room and I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the support I need between my knees and arms. Though I still wake up throughout the night because I have to use the bathroom, this pillow has become a must for me, and I may not switch back to just my normal pillow after I have the baby!'
b'I gave a gift. The recipient called to say she was thrilled with the gift. After opening and using it, it was so much better than she expected and LOVES IT!! She says she has been using it everyday and is great for aligning back, sitting in bed reading and relieving belly stress (is pregnant). She is a massage therapist and says she is going to recommend this pillow for her client with back issues.'
b"I bought this for my second pregnancy, because the pretzel shaped body pillow I used in my first pregnancy was too complicated to rearrange in the middle of the night.  This U shaped pillow is CRAZY comfortable and supportive.  I am a back sleeper, and I dreaded the 5-month requirement to sleep on my side again.  This pillow acts as a pillow for your head, a backrest, and a pillow to support your belly and go between your knees.  It's wonderful, and I've slept wonderfully in it for weeks.  It comes with a cover that--I'm not going to lie--is kind of hard to wrestle on and off.  But other than that I would recommend this to every pregnant woman I know.  When you add another pillow to the top of the back of it, it's also really great for reading in bed."
b'my favorite, after my hysterectomy recovery time and now, I have been using this to support my tummy and back , I\'m side sleeper and this helps elevate my feet.  before this I had to go with 4 pillows in total to do the same and when you need to go rest room in the middle of the night right after surgery, it was a pain to move the pillows and get up (weak stomach muscles ) and if the pillows fall down, you can\'t bend to pick them up and have to wake someone up and disturb them.... now you just move/push away the side and just pull it anywhere and good to go.  I\'m 5.2" and comes almost at my ankle when in side sleeping with bent legs.I washed it too it holds the shape and cover is good quality too.'
b"OMG....I don't know how I survived without one. Definitely not just for pregnant women. I am male and recently had a wrist injury, so sleeping was getting to be difficult hence this purchase. From the first nite I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in.I am also a CPAP user and find this to be an awesome pillow that allows support without creating a lot of pressure on the face mask.All in all a double win for me. Oh yeah, back pain is also less since using this."
b"Fibromyalgia and arthritis. Sleep is really difficult for me. I've been building a fortress of smaller pillows and it wasn't working. Figured I'd try this... I don't know how I'd live without it now! No joke, morning pain cut down over half and I sleep so hard and peacefully! I will take this pillow on vacation, it's that helpful to me!"
b"Oh. This thing is comfortable. I mean I follow the instructions that came with it and up it fluffed out of its very tightly packed box! I sleep with it all the time, even when I'm not pregnant."

b"I was a back sleeper when before I was pregnant but my doctor told me it was better to sleep on my (left) side later in my pregnancy. As much as I tried, I kept waking up in the morning and found myself on my back again (old habits die hard!). I tried a friend's C shaped pillow but couldn't get comfortable, it was too big. I looked for other alternatives and found this pillow to be most attractive based on its shape in the pictures, and also because I read in the reviews of other pillows that the zipper can poke in your belly if it's placed on the edge. Since this pillow has the zipper on the side, it never comes near your belly so it doesn't get uncomfortable.My experience after a week of sleeping with this pillow has been great. I use it mostly for not rolling onto my back, and in that it has been super effective! I wake up every morning on my left side and feel less dizzy after getting out of bed. I used to have some swelling around my ankles and that has also decreased every since I started using this pillow!Lastly, I really liked the marketing of this brand. Their packaging is cute and makes it easy to bring this pillow with you because the pillow becomes smaller than it already is. They have a nice welcome note included with instructions on how to best use the pillow and also mention some tips on how to sleep better. All of it was very thoughtful, and great product to match. Five stars!"
b"Purchased this for a pregnant friend and she loves it so much that I might get one for myself even though I'm not expecting. She tells me about how she uses it a lot for back support in the car and on the couch and I feel that I could use some help there too. I also like to sit on the floor a lot for meditation and yoga purposes and I feel this pillow might be very good for that too. Anyway, this was a great gift idea!"
b'This pillow has been awesome. I am 33 weeks now and I have always been a side sleeper. So far I have no major issues continuing to sleep on my side and havent needed bump support there so I cant really speak to its use for that position. I have occasionally used this pillow between my legs which is nice.My most common use for this pillow is back support when sitting and it has been a godsend. Generally sitting straight up in a chair no matter how cushioned it seems to be, will make my lower back ache after even 10 minutes. Standing or walkimg I am fone but god forbid I sit and rest my feet... go figure... anyway... This pillow solves that problem on most chairs either by giving me support in my lower back or allowing more of a recline. It seems to vary by the chair which position I prefer the pillow to be in. I went on vacation recently and though I brought it, I thought I could do without it on the plane there, save a bit of space, and use a rolled up sweater or partially inflated neck pillow for the 5 hour flight. NOPE big mistake. I had back pain the entire way. I took it on the plane for the flight home and things were much better. When I forget it and try other pillows or other solutions they never work quite as well. Im not sure why ecactly but I am so happy I got it!'
b"Bought this for my wife because she kept tossing and turning at night because she couldn't get comfortable. She already owned Jill and Joey's belt and was very happy with it, so it was worth a shot to try their pillow too. She had tried the big pillows, but those weren't of much help because they were simply too big for in bed. This little pillow gets my wife comfortable so she and I can finally get some sleep. She brings it with her on her commute too and uses it in the office. When my wife is not using the pillow, I sometimes use it too on the couch. It feels of very high quality because it is soft to the touch, but is nice and firm to offer proper support."
b'This product has saved me. I originally bought it to support my tummy but have actually been using it between my knees instead. I was having debilitating pelvic pain for months of my pregnancy (like I could barely walk), and literally within 2 nights of using it between my knees, my pain is totally gone. It\xe2\x80\x99s super firm and added so much more support than a pillow was offering. I just wish I had known about this for my first pregnancy.'
b'The product came as described & was pretty stiff upon first usage. I will say that after plenty of use it has softened up on both sides & is very comforting to use. I use it mostly between my knees & ocassionally like the picture advertised, but anticipate using it mostly for belly support as I get bigger; with twins I figure this will happen sooner rather than later. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also used it as a back support when sitting up in bed & for my level of comfort I\xe2\x80\x99d give it a 3/10 BUT a solid 10/10 for leg & belly support.'
b"I travel a lot for my job, even now that I'm pregnant, so I was looking for a pillow that I could easily take with me without sacrificing support. I liked this pillow best after trying two others as well. These were the deciding factor: the zipper is on the side instead of on the edge so it doesn't hurt my belly. Also, it was firmer than other pillows even though it was the same size. When I held all pillows in my hands and compared them, this one felt most premium. And I love the travel bag that it came in!"
b'This pillow has been perfect for using between my thighs to avoid hip pain during the earlier part of my pregnancy and now as support for my belly in the latter part. The travel bag is convenient and the cover cleans up easily in the washer and dryer. I am so glad that I purchased this and not the much more expensive body pillow options available.'
b'This pillow comes pretty close to the miracle you are looking for to make sleep bearable during pregnancy. After unsuccessfully trying a number of large body pillows that took up far too much real estate in bed (and got way too hot!), this pillow could not have been a better, more efficient find. With a convenient storage bag, I have successfully travelled with the pillow twice and it maintained its shape/form perfectly after folding.'
b'An amazing pillow! My wife enjoys using it at night time on her stomach and it helps immensely with comfort. I steal it from her during the day because the angle is perfect for propping my head and neck at a gradual level for using my tablet. No discomfort at all! The foam filling is firm, but still soft and comfortable. It really does give great support for with the stomach or head and neck.I really want to get one for myself, but I suppose I could just wait until after the pregnancy and use this one. Again, I cannot stress how amazing this product is!'

b"My wife initially ordered the large C-shaped pillow but she hated it. She loves this wedge. It is small so it doesn't take up half the bed and she can take it anywhere with ease. Definitely worth the buy.Update: my wife took this to the hospital during delivery for the labor bed (very uncomfortable) and the post delivery bed. She was grateful to have it. We also now use it to prop up our arms when we are holding the baby since your arms get tired very quickly. Definitely recommend this multi use product."

b'This pillow is amazing!! I literally slept with this every night especially when my belly was supaaa big. My poor husband and dogs were pushed to the side cause this pillow saved my sleeping life!!!! Buy this if you are pregnant or just have a big belly cause this pillow will work wonders and take pressure off of you!'

b"I used the Jill and Joey belt to offload my lower back throughout the day when being on my feet a lot, but still felt unsupported in bed or on the couch at night. This little powerhouse pillow really helped out with that and is a great choice if you don't want to spend a lot of money on an effective support pillow. It offers a lot of support for its size and it's easy to bring with you wherever you go in or outside the house. I recently went on a trip and rolled the pillow up in the cute bag that it comes in, which made it easier to fit in my suitcase. I was very happy I had it with me, used it every day!"
b"I never write reviews but I had to for this pillow. I tried a huge full body pillow and had to return it. This wedge pillow is perfect. I am 23 weeks pregnant and have been using it for about a week. It is very comfortable on either side during sleep. I use it while working as back support. I use it while relaxing on my couch. I even use it to elevate my feet once the oh-so-lovely edema of the day kicks in. The versatility in shape, texture, and use is excellent. Oh and you can easily tote it around with you in the convenient travel bag. I'm going to a BBQ tomorrow and will be bringing it along to stay comfy. I highly recommend this product."
b"I was quite skeptical about a small pillow helping me sleep better, but the firmness of this pillow is quite amazing for its size. A friend of mine owns the hiccapop pillow wedge and gave it to me, but I thought it didn't offer enough support even though it's also made of memory foam. This pillow feels more firm and does a better job of keeping my belly in place when I lay on my side."
b'This pillow has been a lifesaver!  Throughout my pregnancy I spent A LOT of money on various pillows trying to find \xe2\x80\x9cthe one\xe2\x80\x9d that would bring me comfort.  Some of them huge ones, that would practically take up the whole bed.  None of them worked, until I finally found this pillow.  Who knew this pillow would be the solution to all of my problems. And better yet I still use every day now that the baby is here.  It works for everything!  By far the best comfort purchase I\xe2\x80\x99ve made and would recommended to all mommy\xe2\x80\x99s to be.'
b"I'm in my second pregnancy. During my first I had a regular long pillow but toward the end your belly is too big and I ended up taking a towel and folding it to support my big belly just a little (the pillow got too thick!). But it's less confortable. My husband got me this pillow for my current pregnancy and I wish it had existed 3 years ago! I enjoy the support from the end of the first trimester and I will adjust the position until the end with its shape. And it takes less space in the bed so your partner can still have some space :)Also good to support your back while seating but that's a bonus for me not the main purpose.I think this is a must-go for pregnant ladies!"

b"I'm writing this review as the husband of pregnant wife about 5 and a half months along (she uses my Amazon account and doesn't care to write reviews and such). She was having real trouble sleeping until we bought this body pillow. The pillow sort of engulfs her whole body and gives her A LOT of options to get comfortable (supports multiple sleeping positions). If you're a fan of shoving the pillow between your legs you'll love this pillow. She HATES sleeping on her side but this makes it more than tolerable. I hope this review helps pregnant mothers looking for sleeping solutions; I can't speak from first-hand experience but the direct feedback from my wife for the past few weeks leads me to believe this is a fine product."
b"I was going to give this 3 stars because, while it kept me, a devout back-sleeper, on my side, the pillow portion didn't cut it. I get tension headaches and need good support from a pillow. But then I discovered the zippers! I was able to redistribute the filling to make the body support firmer (perfect for me), then slip my orthopedic pillow inside the cover! Now, I can't wait for bed time!"
b'I really love the plushness and comfort of this pillow BUT I wish it was a bit cooler. I wake up sweating every day. I need the pillow for comfort, but it would be seriously worthwhile to make a cool-gel pregnancy pillow. Since pregnant people are already so prone to being warm.Edited to add: After leaving the review as three stars for comfort (two removed for heat). I have to say the customer service provided from this company has been great. They reached out to me to apologize for any inconvenience and I could tell they really internalized the suggestion to use a cool-gel material potentially. Very accommodating and excellent customer service.'
b"Worth every penny!  This has SAVED me during the third trimester discomforts and pains.  I'm SO GRATEFUL for this pillow, and to my husband for getting it.  My hips have been aching which causes me to toss and turn from one side to the other while I sleep...having the full body coverage is crucial because now I don't wake up when I toss and turn.  The shape and weight of the pillow makes it versatile, functional, and healing...my pains have definitely decreased since I've started using it.  I love it so much that I plan on bringing it w/ me to the hospital when I give birth!  I highly recommend...my only complaint is not getting it sooner!"
b'This pillow is great! Have slept awesome the last two nights since I received it. I looked at quite a few on Amazon before choosing this one. As soon as I opened the vacuum sealed package it expanded. It is very fluffy and comfortable. I am happy I spent the little extra money on this one compared to a few of the other ones I looked at. Definitely worth it! The pictures attached are on a king sized bed.'
b"I'm obsessed with this pillow, and I'm NOT pregnant. I had surgery and I was looking for a pillow that would keep me semi upright in bed because i was told sleeping flat would be uncomfortable, and I would just be spending a lot of time in bed so I would need to be propped up. This this is so great. It's comfortable, it's padded enough that it doesn't get smooshed right away. It served it's purpose and more. I'm now 6 weeks out from surgery, and I still sleep with it! haha"
b'I finally bought a pillow for my Third pregnancy...wish I would have with my 1st and 2nd. It does take up some room, but so worth it. Beginning pregnancy, I used it upside down because the pillow seemed too high, but as soon as I was in my 3rd trimester, I used it the correct way and it was perfect.'
b"I've had this product for a few months now and it just keeps making my pregnancy a little more bearable each week. At 28 weeks now, I have terrible heartburn/acid reflux, so being horizontal can make me throw up in my sleep. Luckily, this pillow offers enough support for me to fold it up and lean back against it to get a good night's sleep instead of walking around until I'm sure I won't vomit or have acid reflux while sleeping."
b'This has been a dream.  I previously purchased the snoogle and found it too firm and not providing support where I needed.  Perfect fluff and firmness with out being hard as a rock. I like that it provides leg support AND back support. I remember reading there was a longer version and wish I would have got that one because I like to keep my knees and ankles separated with the pillow to provide the best back support (I\xe2\x80\x99m only 5\xe2\x80\x992). It\xe2\x80\x99s also nice to be able to lean on the pillow with my back while sleeping on my side.  Originally I planned to have the \xe2\x80\x9chead portion\xe2\x80\x9d at my feet because I\xe2\x80\x99m pillow picky and wanted MY pillow under my head, but this pillow is so comfortable I\xe2\x80\x99ve been perfectly happy using it under my head.  It\xe2\x80\x99s hysterical trying to get the pillow case back on, if you\xe2\x80\x99re getting frustrated just imagine it as a large person you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to pull pants on and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop laughing.'
b"I got this pillow fairly early in my pregnancy (just into 2nd trimester) because I was already having trouble sleeping. I could no long sleep on my belly, and then was told not to sleep on my back, which felt the most comfortable to me. I tried sleeping on my side with a pillow between my legs, another behind my back to prop me up if I rolled over on my back...it was annoying and not comfortable. This pillow is amazing! I don't even use my regular pillow, although you could if you wanted to be elevated even more....Now, while I'm still not sleeping great (because of my stretching, heavy belly) at least I'm comfortable, flipping from side to side, or rolling onto the pillow, sleeping almost on my back, but at such an angle that I'm not worried about compromising circulation to my baby. The fill is great, I've traveled with it (stuffing it into a duffle bag--it IS pretty cumbersome, but I didn't want to leave it at home when we traveled out of town for a long weekend!) and it sprung right back to shape, and I've washed the cover already, too. (It doesn't look like it has a slip cover, but it does, it's just white).  Love it!"
b"I received this pillow as a birthday gift and LOVE LOVE it! Takes up alot of the bed, but for now, I sleep alone! My only complaint is, I would shop and buy a cover for it. On nights I fall asleep and don't take my makeup off, it stains the white case it comes in and never really washes out. When I take it to my boyfriends house, because I can no longer sleep without it, He hates the thing! lol"
b'So far, I Love it. I prefer to sleep with it upside down putting the headrest part of the pillow at my feet and using my regular bed pillow for my head instead. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x997 and I find that using the pillow right side up either gets my shoulder caught under the head area or I shuffle the pillow up higher and my legs lack support. Flipping it upside down makes it easier and I\xe2\x80\x99m more comfortable, also this makes it easier to get out of bed for those many trips to the bathroom. Since I\xe2\x80\x99ve figured out what works best for me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from 4-6hours of tossing and turning all night to 7-9 hours of restful nights sleep. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never slept better.'
b"The construction of the pillow itself is sturdy, dense and is clearly well made. My girlfriend (who isn't pregnant) wanted to get one of these to help her with back pain.  She claims it changed her life. She definitely noticed a decrease in back pain. I used to get about 20 percent of the bed to sleep on, but this huge pillow fences her in and has actually kept her corralled to her half of the bed, which i wasn't expecting."
b'This thing is AWESOME. I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting the best sleep, and he LOVES it. This thing isn\xe2\x80\x99t just for pregnancies \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s great for neck and back snuggle/support and wraps you right up. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sturdy and a quality I approve of.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s still early on in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy, but sleeping on her side had her back, neck, and shoulders in a mess. A body pillow was just not doing the job, so I decided to invest in a pregnancy pillow. After comparing all the different products available, I settled on this particular pillow and I am so glad I did! While I cannot claim that it eliminated her discomfort completely, it has certainly helped a lot! It\xe2\x80\x99s well-made and very comfortable. She likes the fact that the cover is cotton and not a thicker fabric that retains more heat. She\xe2\x80\x99s used it for a few weeks now and it has held its shape and fluffiness well. It gives great support without being too large and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smell (which seems like a trivial concern, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant, it\xe2\x80\x99s huge). It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best investments you\xe2\x80\x99ll make!'
b'My wife loves this. She is not prego, but still sleeps with this every night and every nap. She said she likes the way it cradles her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest, I snuck a few naps in with it over the last few months. It is pretty awesome. If we are not laying in it, one of our dogs is. To give an idea on length of it, we are both 6\xe2\x80\x991\xe2\x80\x9d and it goes to A little below my waist (I\xe2\x80\x99m all torso). On my wife it goes closer to her knees (she has a itty bitty toroso and is all legs)'
b"This pillow has been my pregnancy lifesaver. It is plenty firm, with enough fill so that it can be used as a pillow for my head without any additional pillows added. However, if someone were to prefer a less firm pillow, it has a zipper where filling can be removed/redistributed. Also, the cover can be removed and washed. I've done this, and it didn't require too much of an effort to take out and put back into the cover. I love the support it provides to my head, back, belly, and legs. I also love that I can switch sides while sleeping without having to completely rearrange the pillow (not true of C-shaped pillows, regular body pillows, or wedges). On nights where the heartburn has been severe, I've been able to sit the pillow up against my headboard, and it helps me sleep in a sitting position. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
b'This pillow is AMAZING! I am 30 weeks and could not rest or sleep comfortable I would toss and turn all night wake up in awful pain with my hips, lower back in so much pain and sore for weeks. I had tried almost all pregnancy pillows and was hesitant to spend money again on another pillow that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work. But after reading other people\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied reviews I thought why not give it a try! Believe me I am so happy I did, this pillow hugs your body, stomach & back and is very supportive. I use it when relaxing on the couch to watch tv & sleep every night with it. When I\xe2\x80\x99m not using it my husband and kids are lol. The whole family loves it! It comes vacuum sealed tight in a box that is not too heavy and after a few hours it fluffs up and the next day it will be even fluffier. I highly recommend spending the money on this heavenly pillow! Even paid for the extra shipping to get it in two days. I definitely will be bringing it to the hospital with me for delivery and use it everyday after. Hope this helps!'
b'I literally could not sleep without this thing! I have been using it since I was about 20 weeks pregnant and I am currently 36 weeks. The cover washes well, however the pillow is a little hard to stuff back in after washing. I have not put it in the dryer, I always hang it to dry as I was afraid it would shrink. My husband and dogs also enjoy snuggling into it!'
b"I held off on purchasing a pregnancy pillow for so long thinking I could get away with just using stacks of pillows. Around week 32 I spoke with my dr about increased symptoms of sleepless nights due to leg cramps, swelling, lack of back support, and heartburn. She highly encouraged me to purchase a good pillow. So I followed her advice and set out to find something that had support, yet didn't take up my entire bed and make me feel completely separated from my husband. Well, after hours of review I must say this is a winner! My first night I slept like a rock and woke up smiling. Best part is it's firm enough that I can turn my head and see my husband, but soft enough to conform to my body! I highly recommend this product!! The pictures were taken about a month after use."

b"This pillow is high quality! It's huge!! It's fluffy! Long enough to reach my ankles . I'm 5'6. Already washed the cover.  Easy off easy on. Love that the zipper is tucked into a fold. The only downside is the lack of options for replacement covers."
b'Love this. I bought this because I have had 2 back surgeries and neck surgery and is really helping me sleep at night. Best investment!'
b'This pillow has been a lifesaver! I have never slept better. Currently 22 was pregnant and it helps me stay laying on my side throughout the night with great support.'
b'Amazing. I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper so this was amazing'
b"I am not the time to use it, so not open it yet. I touched it, it's so comfortable. Also I think this kind of shape pillow is more functional. Can't wait to use it!"
b'One of the reasons it stands out among other similiar products is the soft and gentle touch of its cotton cover.'

b'I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.My wife was having trouble sleeping since becoming pregnant and purchased the regular sized Queen Rose U Shaped pillow, from which she greatly benefits. It supports her to sleep on either side, which she had a hard time doing before as she is usually a back sleeper and stacking up pillows does not have the same effect. Immediately seeing how it could benefit me as well, I decided to try the King Size pillow (being over 6\xe2\x80\x99 tall, the regular size wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long enough).Laying flat with each side even and straight, the full size of the pillow is about 33\xe2\x80\x9d wide and 64\xe2\x80\x9d long, with each side about 10\xe2\x80\x9d wide. It is well made, soft, and feels nice. The removable cover is a useful feature.The pillow is quite large and if you are sharing a bed with a partner, you will likely want to have at least a queen size bed. If both partners have a pillow, a king size bed is recommended (we didn\xe2\x80\x99t fit too well when we both tried them on our old queen, but we were already upgrading to a split king anyway, so it worked out). If you are sleeping alone, a twin bed will work.I have been using the pillow for a few weeks now and really like it. Being a side sleeper who used to sleep with a second pillow between my legs, it offers support on each side so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have switch the pillow back and forth. It also provides a natural place for both arms, which has always been an issue. I feel better when waking up in the morning (I have persistent shoulder, back, and neck pain) so there may be some pain reduction benefits, although as mentioned above we purchased a new bed around the same time, so it is hard to tell which one is making the difference (I suspect both are contributing). I did use it a few days on our old bed and felt better than with my old pillow. It is too soon to tell whether there will be any long-term pain reduction, although sleeping in more functional positions is a step in the right direction.There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether to purchase a body pillow and which one to choose. This King Size is better for those who are taller or want to manipulate the pillow in various positions. It is softer and the inner material is adjustable by design. This can be a good feature, but also a potential drawback as it can be challenging to get everything just right, although I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found it to be too big of an issue, as I like that I can move in various positions at night and adjust the pillow accordingly with minimal effort. My wife tried the King Size and found it comfortable, but prefers the firmer, shorter (she\xe2\x80\x99s 5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d) pillow. If anyone wants a longer, firmer pillow, additional material could easily be added to the King Size, as there is a opening with a zipper at the top of the pillow.Overall, the Queen Rose pillows are high quality and do what they are supposed to, providing a good option for pregnant and non-pregnant sleepers, female and male (if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t bothered by the odd looks you\xe2\x80\x99ll get when telling people you bought a pregnancy pillow). Having never used a body pillow, my wife and I are very satisfied, although with no basis for comparison, I cannot say whether a cheaper body pillow would offer the same of similar benefits. For pregnancy, it is definitely a worthwhile purchase.'
b"Fits me perfectly and I'm not pregnant.  I feel like I am wrapped up in a cloud.  I'm a side sleeper with bottom leg straight and top leg bent; bottom arm usually under the pillow.  I've always had headaches, neck and shoulder pain from pillows that flatten out or are too thick.  Recently, I started getting bad hip pain and chiropractor recommended a pillow to keep top knee elevated.  Using a regular pillow was cumbersome as was the smaller knee pillows with an elastic strap to attach to one knee, resulting in sleep disruptions every time I tried to turn over.  This U-shaped pillow is perfect for me.  No more headaches, neck, shoulder and hip pain after the first night of use.  The stuffing is firm enough that it doesn't flatten out under my head and knees.  I find I'm sleeping much more soundly and don't wake up during the night just to turn over.  The first night, the outside pillow leg did fall off the bed but I must have figured out how to flip over without pushing it off because it hasn't happened since.  So far, I have not had any problems being too hot, which was an initial concern.  I'm totally thrilled with my purchase and highly recommend this pillow."
b"excellent quality, great stuffing, and while I need to fluff it back after a couple nights sleep, I suppose no other pillow can get away without fluffing. The quality is very good on this and the pillow case was easy to clean and reapply. the instructions are very clear (no washing the inner pillow, hang dry the case) and this really is much more comfortable than the moonlight slumber comfort u pillow. In particular, this pillow does a better job of hugging me and supporting my legs than the comfort u. I found the comfort u was too wide and the support was almost nil after a couple nights. it didn't fluff back up either. The Queen Rose u pillow has held up AWESOMELY for over a month already."
b'If I could give this pillow 10 million stars I would!! I am 55 years old and have scoliosis. I have been chasing chiropractors and physical therapists around for the past year with chronic daily low back, mid back, and neck pain. If one area didn\'t hurt the other ones did. I even tried sleeping on the floor for a few weeks. I bought this pillow for my pregnant daughter in law when she came to visit. When she left, I tried it. I have only used it 2 nights and this is the first time in over a year that I have not hurt during sleep and after. I was even able to sleep on my back (am normally a side sleeper) as the pillow "hugged" my sides and I bent the legs of it beneath my knees to relieve low back pressure. So comfy and comforting. I bought this one because the "legs" of it are longer than most of the others and I need support for my lower leg all the way down to my foot when sleeping on my side. I do bolster the head area with a small flat pillow, but will be going to the craft store to buy more filling. It is great without it though. I like that you can add more stuffing to suit your needs. Oh, and it did well for my pregnant daughter in law too. I am 5\'7". It is plenty long.'
b'Absolutely perfect. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s long enough to rest between both my knees and feet. That\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find. Yes my knees are bent a bit but nothing crazy. Who sleeps straight on their side anyway? This pillow has done wonders for my SI joint pain. I recently learned that sleeping on your side without a pillow between your knees really inflamed that joint and makes the pain worse. Now I sleep with this and have been pain free for two weeks. And it\xe2\x80\x99s great that I can hug it too. Or if I roll onto my back, I just put it under my knees to avoid angering that SI joint in that position. This pillow has worked miracles for me. My low back pain was ruining my life and now I am able to sleep so much better and I feel so much better in the morning. I also like that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to move the pillow if you turn over on the other side. And if you need a little support to lean you back against, works great for that too. Seriously worth the money. And it\xe2\x80\x99s very fluffy, took a couple days to fluff up fully like the little note from the company said. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more than full enough to be supportive. But it now!!'
b"I have slept with this since I got it. I have had 2 discectomy surgeries on my back, have residual pain and suffer from back tremors. With this pillow, I eliminated two side pillows, one for my feet, and one for my head. I still use one foam pillow, because I like my head more elevated when I sleep. I got the gray pillow, which is like a velure fabric. Honestly, would have loved this even more if the pillow case had been a jersey t-shirt knit, because it is very hot sometimes to sleep with. I will probably pick up a jersey sheet at a garage sale or thrift store to make one or two. I don't wake up as much at night in discomfort, toss and turn a lot less, and can position myself easier. My husband hates it, but admits I sleep better. We have a queen bed, so he thinks I take up too much room, but I feel it is still about half. This has saved me from begging my husband for new mattress, since ours is only about 5 years old and still good. I also wake up a lot less stiff in the morning, and almost no pain. I know these are supposed to be for pregnant women, but absolutely fabulous for people with back problems!"
b"It takes up a lot of room... even on a California King mattress but so worth it. I sleep like a baby on it. It can be molded and twisted to accommodate any sleeping or sitting position.  I wish I would have discovered this pillow when I had my mastectomy and I couldn't sleep in any position but on my back. It's kinda like a baby wedge to keep you from rolling over."
b'I was not sure about this pillow and I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure. It baffles me and for me maybe a miracle?!! I bought this pillow in hope that I might be able to stay in one position while sleeping. I have always been a problem sleeper (terrible) and actually injured my middle/upper back last August sitting up in the bed to flip over. I have no idea what it is like to sleep normal without constantly moving in my sleep, dreaming, wrestling something unknown. NOW is this new sleep I\xe2\x80\x99m experiencing normal? The pain in my back reoccurred several weeks ago. I was desperate to find something to keep me from moving about in my sleep. My back is feeling almost 100% and I wake up in the morning in the same position. It is so strange and unfamiliar for me to wake up not even being aware I was asleep or even in a bed. Sleep is now so empty and blank. I look so forward to going to bed to see if this is really real. Will I ever get used to this new normal? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if this is normal because I have never experienced it before. I know this probably makes no sense and yes I am dumbfounded. Sleep for me now has never felt so strange lol but I feel great! I LOVE THIS PILLOW!'
b"I am 67 with previous back surgery and 2 dislocated shoulders and lupus which makes your body ache all the time. But the worst was trying to find a position for sleeping at night.This has changed my life. I was going to purchase a new bed but after looking at beds for weeks I just didn't see much difference. Plus the prices on queen mattresses was overwhelming. So I researched these pillows after getting a pop up ad on another brand. After checking these out I chose this one because of the length and it was reviewed to be very bendable like a nest so you can wrap it around you, or stretch the bottom out to raise your knees,so I can use it for many positions. They said they would have covers coming out soon. You can take the outer cover off and wash it but don't put in dryer just hang to dry. I use a bottom sheet to wrap around it until I get a cover. Also if it doesn't have enough bulk for you it has a zipper that opens to add more stuffing if you want. Definitely the best and at this price could do better."
b'I searched and search and searched for a good pregnancy pillow to help with my chronic acid reflux. I saw so many reviews of other products where they has torn soon after purchase. I decided on this one, and couldn\'t be happier. The cover has held up well through washing and drying (but you do have to hang dry it)..My only "complaint" about this product (and it\'s a small and easily remidied one), is that if you are used to using a pillow between your knees to sleep on your side, this is just a bit too narrow. However, all you have to do is slip a pillow underneath it where your knees would be, and it\'s totally fine.'
b'I am not pregnant. I bought this to replace the four pillows that I usually use to support my back and hips. I need pillows on both sides because I am a side sleeper and need to switch sides a few times during the night. Verdict is...i love my new pillow! I still need to switch sides, but not as often. And because I no longer have to readjust all my pillows,  I barely wake up and easily go back to dreamland. Pillow keeps me nice and aligned. Perfect softness/firmness for my comfort.  I also love it for sitting up in the morning drinking coffee in bed and reading at night.'
b'Best purchase ever. I am 69 and obviously not pregnant. I bought it as an experiment to see if it could help me not roll onto my back because I snore and have sleep apnea when I do. It works really quite well \xe2\x80\x93 I use a snore monitoring app that shows that since using the pillow I have been snoring a lot less; I wake up feeling much more refreshed too. What I do is hug once side of the pillow and pull the other side close to my back. if I get too hot, I usually let go and then I will end up on my back again, so it is not a foolproof solution, but it is helping me delay getting a C-Pap machine. Highly recommended.'
b'This is a terrific product. I read all the reviews before I purchased one.  Yes, it certainly fills up the bed; yes, it makes things a bit warm--I bought one during the hot summer months in the south. And I can only wholeheartedly recommend it based on my experience!  No, I am not pregnant. I am a 70 year old woman with some aches and pains, and this pillow has revolutionized my sleeping experience and improved my morning aches better than any pill could! I would recommend one for anyone suffering from the same.  Only complaint -- I want a pillow case for the darned thing!'
b'Bought this for my wife, who is not pregnant. She wanted a large pillow to wrap around her at night, shield herself from my tossing and turning at night, and to "cuddle" with when I am all cuddled out..... Needless to say she loves this pillow and now refers to it as her "boyfriend".'
b"I love this pillow! It is much longer than many I've seen and doesn't force you to sleep with your legs in a 45* angle to enjoy the snuggle comfort of it. It seemed very small when I took it out of the package but over two days it bulked up in size. I was not a fan of the cover however. It felt very scratchy and was not comfortable to sleep on. I took off the cover and was fine sleeping on the pillow itself. I contacted customer service to find out if there was an alternative case to purchase. I received a reply within 30 minutes stating they are 3 weeks out from new covers and would be willing to send me a new cover when they become available.  Now that is customer service! I will update once the new cover is received."
b'It provides added comfort to my bed. I would like to find another color  pillow case for it. I am happy with this purchase. I have had a lengthy illness and spend lots of time in bed, so this pillow was well worth the money.'
b"Buy some extra pillow stuffing as many have recommended.  This is definitely money well spent, but in about two months many of the key support points need some extra stuffing to perk it right up.  Simply unzip, take some foam stuffing and put a few handfuls and rearrange it to suit your comfort needs.  This pillow will continue to provide me with full body comfort for some time to come.  Oh, and for the first time it'll fill out to full size in a day or two, but you can still use it right out of the box."
b"Purchased s a gift for my pregnant wife to help her with a more restful sleep. It definitely works more often than not and seems to have reduced her snoring some as well. Fluffy and relatively firm for MY liking. Putting a pillow case on this beast is like trying to put clothes on a 10' snake. Overall, she loved her surprise; she's only without it when the pillowcase is in the wash."
b"In preparation for my mastectomy surgery, I researched the items that would best help me convalesce.  This pillow is BY FAR the best thing I could have purchased.  Started using it a few weeks before surgery and  was able to get and stay comfortable in a variety of positions.  Now that I'm home from the hospital, I am more grateful than ever.  Even right after surgery I was able to rearrange the pillow by myself - it's pretty big! - but just sinking in to my nest and having the support and comfort I needed was vital.  I am able to get and stay comfortable all the time.  THANK YOU for making this product."
b'I order this pillow for my pregnant Daughter who was having a very hard time getting comfortable to sleep at night! She instantly fell in love with this pillow and texted me during a restroom trip during the night to tell me how amazing she was sleeping ! The only issue was her hubby said they needed to call it her "SNOR PILLOW "... LOL... it\'s an amazing product that arrived very quickly and allowed my VERY CRANKY PREGNANT  Daughter to finely get some much needed relaxing restful sleep!!... THANK YOU QUEEN ROSE we\'re all sleeping better now!!!...\xf0\x9f\x98\x82'

b"I am 25 weeks pregnant and have been having troubles with my hips/knees/belly when I'm trying to sleep. So bad actually, that I will toss and turn all night. This pillow changed all of that literally overnight. I fell asleep in 20 min (which is incredible for me) and stayed asleep and in the same spot until I woke up! It is well worth the money as it is a nice and heavy pillow and the cover is such a comfy material that doesn't get hot while you're hugging it. This pillow is a total game changer and I would buy this as a gift for pregnant women!"
b"If you want the most comfort ....and versatility ot of your pillow.  Get this swag art from pharmedic. At half the price of the rose one this is by far smashing the comp. My wife got this one after the first one got ruined.  And since I work nights....I steal it while she's up during the day.  Muahaha.Cover unzips for washing. The shape is good for multiple positions and the big one is man size.Happy sleeping!"
b'This pillow has helped me so much with my low back pain I am sleeping through the night'
b'Super helpful for hip and knee discomfort. Keeps the whole body warm. I have to figh the dog over it it. Excellent for neck distress as well.'
b'Fantastic pillow, so comfortable, versatile and not too big! I still have some problems on sleeping on the side, but the pillow helps a lot.'
b"Very comfy my bae love it. It's a white pillow with a blue or pink cover for easy cleaning."
b"Love the pillow. I'm 18w and have just started having significant discomfort when sleeping and this pillow has made it so much easier to get good solid rest every night. Love that I can remove and wash cover often."
b'Loved!'
b'My husband bought me this pillow. He hates that it takes up half the bed, but his glad he go it for me. I Love this pillow. Helps me sleep better at night and easy to move around.'
b'Works great to protect my injured shoulder. Bought on recommendations from my physical therapist.'
b'Best pillow ever made! Very comfortable'
b'Super comfy and soft'
b'Amazing wife and kids love it'
b'Best pillow ever. I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 18 weeks but got this pillow pretty early with having difficulties sleeping and not getting comfortable. It has made such a difference and helped me sleep and get comfortable even during the day as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s long and really wraps around so comfortably. Highly recommend!'
b'I love this pillow! And so does my whole family. It really makes a difference in this pregnancy. You can turn it into multiple positions for your feet, belly, head and arms. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up too much room on the bed and the pillow case it is in is great! It is so soft and easily comes on and off to wash. It is not too firm and not too squishy either, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. I want to get one for every room in the house! Love this pillow'
b'My wife is pregnant and we were looking for body pillows. When we stumbled on to this. I have to say that I am upset I didnt get one for myself!!! This pillow is like sleeping in heaven! Extremely comfortable and thinking about getting one for myself. Definitely a very good product.'
b"I ordered this and she loves it. This is very helpful in her sleeping process as it's hard to find the right support. In fact I really liked it and got one for myself...."
b'This pillow is a lifesaver! I was having a hard time getting comfortable for bedtime, now I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping like a champ!'
b'Super comfortable and was a lifesaver during my pregnancy. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep without it'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s so comfy in reasonable price, I use it as a pregrancy pillow'

b'I feel like this pillow has made a huge difference when sleeping or lounging. Sleeping on my side became uncomfortable and painful at about 6-7 months. I bought this pillow, which is firm and had the support I needed! I am now 39 weeks and still using it! I\xe2\x80\x99m also going to take it to the hospital with me because I love the support it gives me. When I first got the box, it was smaller than expected, I am weighing 220+ lbs so I figured it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work, but it works!!! It\xe2\x80\x99s a firm cushion, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it memory foam. The cover is nice and soft. It was the perfect coverage I needed for my growing belly! Would definitely recommend it!!'
b"I got this for my friend who is currently 6 months pregnant with her second child. She said she loves it because it relieves pressure on her stomach when she's lying down and that she can also use it for her back. She takes it with her all over the house, not just the bedroom. It look's smaller in person than I expected which might not be the best for people who carry a bit larger or are having twins/triplets..etc. I'm definitely looking forward to getting one of my own when I decide to have kids."
b'I am 27 weeks pregnant and I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep without this pillow anymore. It gives my belly bump support and makes me feel comfortable. I sleep on my left side and this pillow was all I needed.'
b'Absolutely love this wedge pillow. The memory foam is pretty good quality for the price of the pillow. My aunt purchased one from bed bath & beyond for 60+ after having her back surgery and I could never justify paying that much just for a pregnancy pillow.I have been using nightly since received and It supports the ever growing belly so well. It is super comfy, easy to wedge underneath you. If only I bought two for when I switch from side to side lolDefinitely recommend this pillow for the price. Also really like that it has a removable cover for wash.'
b"I wanted a pregnancy pillow to use for hip support between my knees and for my back, and this works perfectly. I didn't want one of the big pillows that take up majority of your bed, but rather something a bit more simple that didn't need much space. This pregnancy wedge pillow does the trick. The material is very soft, but the pillow itself is quite firm which is great since I've never had to worry about it going flat like other pillows will between your knees. Overall a great product I'd recommend to anyone looking for support without taking up the entire bed from A traditional pregnancy pillow."
b'I regret not getting it earlier!  It was firm but comfortable.  Material is very soft, and its easy to maneuver under the sheets when I change positions. I still use it after birth,  and it really helped my c-section recovery too! Other reviews I had read said something about a chemical like smell??  and so, yes it was there at first, only slightly, but it quickly went away.  So no worry there!'
b'So helpful throughout my pregnancy! And now that I\xe2\x80\x99m nursing in bed I can use it behind me so I can lean back a little too.'
b'bought this for a friend who is expecting.  She loves it!  perfect for on the go.  she has it in her car, then brings it to her desk for extra back comfort.'
b'Ok. So I bought this for my wife who is almost 5 months pregnant because she was having a hard time sleeping because of her belly, within 20 minutes she was out like a light. For the first 10 minutes all she kept saying repeatedly was "This is Great"! Definitely a worthy purchase. Thank you.'
b'Perfect product. Helps provide support fa my growing tummy and doubles to help preventing me from back sleeping in late pregnancy'
b'While I\xe2\x80\x99m not very far along, I am a little over weight and the pill stops the pulling sinsation I get when I lay on my sides without it.'
b"Got this for my pregnant sister-in-law.  She loves it.  She uses it all the time, not just for sleeping.  Says it's the only thing that makes her back stop hurting."
b"I love this pillow. I use it a lot in between my legs as i sleep for hip support. But it does help when laying down, relaxing under my belly, I'm pregnant with twins and any little relief is super helpful. Even sitting on my chair I use it for back support."
b'Perfect as a belly support or a back support.'
b"It's super comfortable and helps me sleep better while pregnant"
b'Super helpful for sleeping!  Helps support belly and my back'
b'Quality'
b'Love this pillow, makes pregnancy a little easier!'
b"Finally used it yesterday since I was having pain in my stomach and back and I felt better within minutes and slept like a baby lol. This felt so comfortable and soft I couldn't believe it. Now I will sleep with it every night especially when I'm in pain"
b'Sister loved it'

b'(Preface: This is advance "permission" (haha) for all the been-there-done-that moms to laugh at what I\'m about to write, lol.) So, I\'m 16 weeks pregnant with my first, and I\'ve been *stunned* at how uncomfortable I got so fast. Standing, walking, and sitting aren\'t too bad most of the time, but laying down... for me, it\'s a lovely blend of seriously-uncomfortable and somewhat-painful. I hear it\'s normal, at least. I was relying on my beloved body pillow for a while, but it wasn\'t enough. Time to grab the wallet and go pregnancy pillow shopping. After reading a ton of reviews, I settled on this one even though it\'s a bit more spendy. I think it\'s worth it for the zippered pillowcase alone. Annnnyway: It hasn\'t completely rid me of the discomfort and pain, nor did I expect it to. But it\'s lessened those quite a bit, and that made it worth every penny. I thought the part where my head goes would be too thick and give me neck pain, but it hasn\'t [knock on wood]. I don\'t understand the physiological reasons why this provides me so much comfort, but it does.Note: This thing *is* enormous, like people say. We have a king size bed, and it takes up half the bed. My husband calls the pillow Big Bertha. :-) He says he misses me, "buried over there amongst Big Bertha", but he\'s delighted that I\'ve gotten some relief. I\'ve caught him napping in it a couple times. So amusing.Size note, because I appreciate it when others include this: I\'m 5\'5", and on the plus-size side. This fits me pretty perfectly, though it\'d be nice if the \'legs\' were just a bit longer. Not enough of a complaint to take off a star, though.Follow-up: I\'m now at 31 weeks, and am convinced I simply couldn\'t live without this thing. I\'m positive my sleep quality would be much poorer without it. I even took it with me for an overnight hotel stay (traveling by car, obviously). If I could wave a magic wand, I\'d make it a little longer. But that\'s it. And that\'s not enough of a detraction to merit the loss of a star. I\'d still give this 6 stars if I could.'
b"This pillow is awesome!  As someone who flips side to side multiple times, every night, I hate changing sides with 1 pillow.  With this oversized pillow, I don't have to.  It is very soft and conforms to your body, feels as though you're being snuggled all night.  I was a little worried about overheating, as I run hot when I sleep- but I haven't found that to be a problem.  Since being pregnant, I've been waking up with pain in my hips every morning.  This has alleviated that problem and leaves me feeling refreshed upon waking.  I'm not sure I'm going to be able to stop using it after I deliver.The only downside: my pets don't understand how to snuggle with me and the pillow.  I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out, at some point.  Until then- I'm sleeping like a champ."
b"I love this pillow!  I am a side-sleeper and I've recently started waking up with neck pain. Since using this pillow, neck pain has not been a problem.  Also, this pillow is cozy and I no longer need to figure out what to do with my arms while on my side.  Like others, I wish replacement pillow covers were available.  The cover is washable, but I would like other color options besides white, or maybe even some cute patterns."
b'Do not wait to purchase this pillow. I bought this at 16 weeks and it has helped me so much already. My hips and back were already achy and I have round ligament pain. This helps support my neck, back, and pelvis so I can sleep. It does get a little toasty but I sleep with a cold room anyway.  5\'6", 146 lbs and 17+4 now and I\'m so glad to have this little piece of heaven.'
b"I'm not pregnant, never have been, but this has made sleeping a lot cozier and has helped me to stay on my side (I snore). Great for all sorts of sleeping positions and I feel so snuggled."
b'Y\xe2\x80\x99all! This pillow is amazing! It cradles my neck perfectly, I feel like freakin Goldie locks- not too firm, not too soft! The slip cover is perfectly soft and there was no funky smells! I have chronic neck pain due to my skeletal system, so buying a pillow is a huge deal! I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent 100\xe2\x80\x99s of dollars on pillows AND AFTER YEARS I FOUND THE PERFECT PILLOW FOR side sleepers/arm/ neck pain!!!!!'
b"all i can say to this pillow is, OMG... i have never experienced a pillow like this. the best night sleep ever. i have severe fibromyalgia, and this pillow is a God send. i don't move at all during the night, i don't wake up during the nights, it is like sleeping on a cloud. this pillow was delivered lighting fast and came as described. the only con i do have for this item is that, i can't find the dimensions nor a extra pillow case for this pillow. other wise i give this item a total thumbs up..."
b"My husband got this for me, and it is absolutely fantastic. I'm a stomach sleeper, so this was a life saver to keep me from rolling onto my stomach while pregnant. We purchased it when I was about 16 weeks pregnant, and now at 31 weeks pregnant I am still in love with it. I cannot imagine sleeping without it. It comes with a pillow case on top of the actual pillow which allows for you to wash the outer casing. It didn't shrink in the dryer, which is a plus. It arrived incredibly quickly, I think maybe 3 days after ordering, and it's just a 10 out of 10 would recommend would purchase again."
b"Well let me start off  by saying I am a guy and I bought this pillow for myself and I am in love with it. I initially bought this pillow to replace  my flat body pillow but I also got an added bonus. It keeps me from rolling around and elevates head enough to where I do not snore as much. I still snore but it now sounds like a little baby instead of a freight train blaring it's horn. I can assure you that my partner enjoys the added bonus. I have only one problem with the pillow. It can retain my body heat, but my solution was just to take off my covers. I cannot guarantee that this pillow will stop you from snoring or may suit your comfort level but I do recommend giving it a try."
b"This pillow has been a life-saver for me during my pregnancy! So happy with my purchase. Amazing how well it supports my belly, back, and legs all at the same time. Thanks to this, I've been able to get good sleep even 8 months into my pregnancy."
b"I am 5 months pregnant with hip issues and was looking for something big and fluffy but yet firm. This is it! it definitely gives support on all the right places. I am 5'6 and I like that it's long enough for me to put the end part in between my legs for extra hip support. Best purchase I've ever made! Also, just a heads up this pillow is pretty wide. If you have a queen size bed it'll take up a lot space."
b"I love this pillow! I'm 20 weeks pregnant and a few weeks ago my back started to hurt really badly. I tried using regular pillows to support my back when sleeping on my side, but it didn't work well. With this pillow, I can move it into a shape that fits my body and my back hasn't hurt ever since! I'll be using this pillow even after I have my baby. So glad I found this!"
b'I have multiple sclerosis and with that comes significant peripheral neuropathy and lower back pain. I have tried everything to help me sleep and this pillow is amazing. It keeps my back supported and allows me to keep my legs from touching while I sleep. I have been using it for months and I highly recommend it.'
b'This is the craziest looking pillow but I absolutely love it.  I had a problem with arm falling asleep when I slept at night because I sleep with my arms under my head.  Now I sleep with a space between my arm and the bed and my arm no longer falls asleep.  This is an amazing pillow!'
b'Excellent quality in materials, comfort, multi purpose Body Pillow. The  Down filling provides great support and comfort in any sleep position.  On sale price is affordable. Highly recommend .  delivered Expediently as Prime member.  thank you for a really nice Product.Diana Hutchison'
b"I have multiple sleeping disorders and this has been an amazing solution to getting better sleep. My husband calls it my nest and it just feels so calming and supportive. It has allowed me to fall into a deep enough sleep to dream which I haven't done in years !"
b'I previously had bought a pillow similar to this at Shopko, and thought this one would be the same, but it was not. The pros: holds its shape really well, has a removable/washable cover that is pretty soft. Cons: it is a lot smaller than the other pillow I had, so when sleeping on my side, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide enough support to my lower back where I need it. It is also a bit lumpy and stiff, but for those who like a more firm pillow, this might be great! It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a better pillow than standard, so I still enjoy it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not 5 stars worthy.'
b"I love this pillow! My husband bought it for me. I'm 20 weeks pregnant and I have sciatica - I fall asleep right away now and it is the perfect thickness. I read reviews on some other more expensive pillows and how they can hurt your neck/shoulder and I don't have this issue with this pillow. Being able to sleep on my side with it between my legs is very helpful for my nerve pain and it feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud! I'm so glad I purchased it. -Julie"
b'So comfy and doesn\'t go too flat and isn\'t too puffy and suffocating either... I was worried it wouldn\'t be long enough but me being 5\'7", the ends still reach to go between my legs! And shipped quick, which was important.'
b"I actually bought this pillow for my boyfriend and he loves it!  He seems to sleep better with it and it's cut down on his snoring, probably because it helps him sleep on his side and not his back.  It has just the right support. I just wish I could get a pillowcase in a darker color."

b'I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through every preggers pillow on the market, and this is by far my favorite because it has been the most effective. I\xe2\x80\x99m a back sleeper so I needed to train myself to sleep on my side.  The Hiccapop was the only other keeper, as the wedge has become a necessity to support my belly the bigger it gets. The Snoogle and other body pillows were way too hot and got in the way of my 16 nightly bathroom trips. None of them kept me on my side anyway. I could go through the list of all the others and why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, but all that matters is that this one is the best. It\xe2\x80\x99s multifunctional; it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect size; it\xe2\x80\x99s firm, yet soft and it actually stays cool. I was initially surprised by the filling..they\xe2\x80\x99re like beads almost, but I love it, as it makes it easy to \xe2\x80\x9cmold\xe2\x80\x9d into the shape you need it for at the time. Great for front or back support if you\xe2\x80\x99re laying on your side, behind the back or neck sitting up, and awesome in between your knees/legs. The pillow case fabric is super soft too. And I love that the case is removable and washable, but there is no annoying zipper you have to try to avoid. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little thing tucked in and you just have to hook a paper clip or something similar to pull it off and remove it. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to using this when baby is here too!Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend to anyone looking for an amazingly comfortable and multi use pillow...before, during and after pregnancy.'
b'The best pregnancy thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve bought for sleeping!!!! I even returned my body pillow after finding this was much more functional. I struggled for weeks tossing and turning placing a pillow under my stomach. This solves all of that! I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 39 weeks and have had it for over a month. I tried to sleep without it one night and woke up in the middle in such bad pain!!! That\xe2\x80\x99s been the only night I\xe2\x80\x99ve *tried* to go without it. The padding on the sides is the perfect density and thickness. The belt part could be much better and made sturdier, as ive tried to move it a couple times and heard seams rip, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely comfortable and so far holding up well. It could also be a little smaller as it\xe2\x80\x99s quite large on me and I\xe2\x80\x99m in no way big, definitely average sized.'
b"I love this maternity pillow, makes sleeping so much better! I was debating between this pillow and a larger body pillow and decided for the Babymoov due to it's more compact size and I am so glad I did! It has just the right amount of support for my belly as I sleep on the side these days and it's rounded shape hugs the shape of my belly. I love it so much I now use it for everything: back rest while sitting, between my legs, and as a foot rest when I come home from work with swollen feet. I also like the soft fabric on both sides, and it has a cover that is washable."
b"I started using it at 6 months pregnant and it works wonders in getting a good night's sleep. The front of the belt has a very soft fabric with elastic at the top and bottom which feels nice and comfortably hugs your belly while the sides have foam pillows that gives you support while sleeping. You can adjust the belt at the back. I sleep on the side and it fills the gap between my waist and the bed really nicely and provide just the right amount of support throughout the night. I've been using regular pillows to get some support and I am so happy I discovered the  Babymoov belt.I find  it also to be a much better alternative to the big pregnancy pillows which take so much space in bed. I also purchased their travel pillow for foot or head support and love it as well."
b'I just purchased my third one of these.  The first I used throughout my pregnancy for sleep. This pillow was in the delivery room and then recovery and was so nice to have for all.  It went from pregnancy pillow to breastfeeding pillow overnight.  And now my 8 week old loves to lounge on it in my lap.  I HIGHLY recommend this pillow.  I get 10x more use out of this pillow over my boppy pillow.  Honestly wish I had another one of these instead of the boppy.  I now have three because my first one is pretty worn in at this point and not as supportive but still useable.  And I bought a 3rd one on a lightning deal.  I feel the more the better because the minute this pillow isn\xe2\x80\x99t available for purchase will be a sad day in my household.'
b'Item got here on time and was just as described!  It is WAY better than needing to put large, bulky pillow on both sides'
b"My wife started using it at around 7 months in, and it has saved her so many hours of sleep. She went through the pillows and didn't do much, but this one works, especially since it is worn on herself, unlike the pillows that shifted. The material is very soft, washable, and not bulky. She highly recommends it."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 31 weeks and this thing is amazing! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it 2 nights and have noticed a big difference! While I sleep with a huge u body pillow, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the right support on my sides without a lot of repositioning (this is just in the last couple weeks as my belly has grown). This belt is amazing because it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially 2 pillows strapped to me, so I can roll around all I want and not have to wake myself to reposition pillows. I love it! Hoping the pillows don\xe2\x80\x99t flatten over the next weeks though!'
b'Love this thing. My back hurt so much before while I slept with a pillow under my belly. This makes it so much more comfortable. Totally worth the purchase.'
b'I love this belt. Has helped immensely with my back pain while I sleep, is adjustable for a wide variety of sizes, & super comfortable. Between this & my pregnancy pillow, I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a small bubble.'
b'This thing is a life saver!! Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep without it! Helps so much with round ligament pains and overall back pains. Within about 30 min of not wearing it I immediately realize why I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable! I have two body pillows and a leg pillow. This thing is my favorite. Then the leg pillow. The Body pillows felt amazing, but eventually started to hurt my neck. Not sure why.'
b'So, yesterday I received my belly pillow & here is my personal review:I used the pillow as a lounge around at first and it did help with pressure (on the sides) when sitting & I used it last night while sleeping and it actually made a difference. Of course being pregnant \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb0\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbe you\xe2\x80\x99re going to toss and turn and have to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, but while sleeping on my sides I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any pressure or cramps I was very comfortable. My only \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d comment about it is the Sam as the other ladies, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit big currently (I am 29wks & due December 2018) but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure as I get further along, it will start to fit just a bit better. Other than that I give it 4.5 \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f rating and would recommend it to any of my pregnant friends! \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b"This product is incredible. I use it in my office, in my bed, everywhere I go. Supplies great support while also being incredibly comfortable. I'm sure it works great for pregnant women and babies too!"
b"I am 32 weeks along and I have been using this for about 5 days now and I've already noticed a difference in my comfort level when I sleep.  I have a bad back and the last  couple of weeks I had very little sleep due to back pain and the inability to get comfortable.  I had used multiple pillows to try and get comfortable but they were either big and bulky or didn't provide enough support.  This belt has memory foam cushions that support the belly and my back when I'm  sleeping on either side and stays in place all night long. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81"
b"Love this pillow! I am pregnant & bought this to use as a support for my belly & arm to rest on while sleeping. It has great support! I am looking forward to using with baby after he's born. I think it'll make a great nursing pillow as well. I highly recommend this even though it is a bit pricey."
b'This is probably my favorite pregnancy purchase! We have a queen size bed and a huge body pillow just isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option.  This little guy has become my best friend- and will stay that way after the baby comes.  I use it to prop up my back, between my legs, for belly support, and sometimes I just hug it at night and it keeps me up on my side (and snuggles me when my husband own\xe2\x80\x99t!).  It\xe2\x80\x99s soft yet when pressure is applied, it keeps its firmness instead of getting squished which is ideal.  My hubby even steals it when I get up in the morning and when he kicks me in his sleep it acts as a shield, what does this thing not do?!  Just the best purchase ever!'
b'This pillow has made sleep much more comfortable. Side cushions helped alleviate much of the rib pain I was experiencing at night while sleeping on my side. I also feel like my growing belly is well-supported using this belt. Bought this belt while 36-weeks pregnant. Regret not purchasing it sooner!'
b'Perfect for people with neck problems.'
b'Love \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f this pillow it Great \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbe for my legs and back doing pregnancy. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste money on the cover though.'
b"The pregnancy pillow it's comfortable. My wife is 5 months pregnant and helps her sleep very well."

b'This was loaned to me due to the fact I have a shattered spine that is essentially discintegrated. I need a lot of support while sleeping to get thru the night. I have never quite had what I would call pain free rest. Until this pillow......wow is an understatement. I can wrap this thing around and thru in a way it fully supports me. That moment of realization you feel no pressure...is when you fall asleep and get rested. I will buy again.'
b"Bought it at the end of my first trimester, and begrudgingly so. I was skeptical of spending this much money on a pillow. I WAS WRONG. This pillow is so fantastic that I have given her a name. I regret nothing. The length is great (I'm 5'9 so I'm tall) and the cover is SO SOFT. Love that is can be removed and washed really easily to, but I haven't actually washed it yet so I can't really say how it washes up. I love her and cannot imagine sleeping through my pregnancy without her."
b"I cant even explain how much I love this pillow. I bought 4 pregnancy pillows before I decided on this one. I am 3 months pregnant and even if I wasn't, I would still love this pillow. It has the perfect amount of firmness, and is just sooo comfortable! I feel like I am sleeping much better with this pillow. I bought another one to try but am not even going to bother with it, since I have been so comfortable with this one. I do with it was a little longer, but that is just because I am tall and its my preference, but honestly..it is fine how it is and works great. Love my new pillow!"
b"This is the best sleep I've had in a very long time! This pillow is a life saver. I ordered the extra long pillow with the removable cover. I got exactly that and it's exceeded my expectations. I'm not pregnant....long past that phase in my life. However, I do sleep on my side for the most part and usually have my head slightly elevated. I have gone from waking up multiple times in the night to readjust pillows that have slipped out of place to sleeping all the way through the night without having to make adjustments. The pillow is slightly firmer than what I was used to but it offers great support and keeps me from rolling onto my back and off the pillows. Love it!"
b'The best pregnancy pillow ever! This is the second pillow I got from Ang Qi. My husband after using my 55 inch one loved it so much I ordered him a longer one! I love the jersey cover because it is so easy to take off and put back on. My sister-in-law got a different pillow when she got pregnant and it was a pain to wash the cover because it was so difficult to take off and put back on. The jersey cover it came with is stretchy so it eliminates that problem completely. The cover is also very soft and keeps me cool during the hot summer nights! I absolutely love this pillow and would recommend it to anyone (not just pregnant women) who is in need of a body pillow!  (Even our dog loves the pillow!!)'
b"I'm 5'9'' and this pillow has changed my entire course of sleep, in a good way!! Like most, I wish I would've ordered this pillow when my pump started to show. I cannot sleep without this pillow! I have tried and it's hell! Lol! I am now 33 1/2 weeks pregnant and it's the only thing that helps me get through the night! When we travel to my mom's my boyfriend already knows that we are not to leave the house without that pillow or it will be a VERY long unpleasant weekend. Lol! I recommend this pillow to all pregnant and non pregnant women and folks alike!"
b'Do not look any further! This pillow is fantastic, the cover is so soft and its the perfect amount of support. I researched a ton of these and finally decided on this. I am 21 weeks pregnant but I have been having a hard time sleeping without hip pain for a few weeks. This was 100% solved by this pillow. I look forward to going home and curling up inside of it. Even my husband is jealous!'
b'Love love love it. Should have bought one of these 15 years ago'
b'So happy with my purchase! I\xe2\x80\x99m 6 months pregnant and have been using this body pillow for about a month and a half now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sleeping much better at night. This is my second pregnancy. I used the C shaped body pillow for my first pregnancy, and I think this pillow is much more comfortable. I ordered the gray velvet pillow cover and have no regrets! It\xe2\x80\x99s so soft, great pillow! It\xe2\x80\x99s also narrower than other similar pillows that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, which gives my husband more room on his side in our queen size bed.'
b'This pillow is a (preggo) lifesaver!! At 22 weeks pregnant, the aches and pains started setting in - waking me up and causing me to limp out of bed in the morning. I tried pillows on every angle...in front, back, between the legs, etc., without relief. After two weeks of misery, I ordered this pillow, and have slept soundly and painfree ever since!Length is also a bonus! I am 6\xe2\x80\x991\xe2\x80\x9d and while I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a surplus of length in this pillow, I am able to put the ends between my knees. The name brand pillow that I tried in store was not long enough for this. I do find that I still need 1 extra pillows for the legs to feel well enough supported.I am slightly worried about how long the stuffing will hold up, but for now I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a cloud.'

b'This pillow has taken away all of my nighttime hip pain! I am sleeping SO much better with this pillow. The snoogle was not fluffy enough to provide support and because its shaped like a "C", every time I turned, Id have to turn it with me, pain. This pillow being shaped like a U, just stays in place as I move around and it is much more full, so it seems to provide better support and also keep me from rolling totally flat on my back. Love.'
b'This pillow is so great! 2nd pregnancy and I have given up the stacked pillow fort of the old days. It is very cozy and comfortable- just wish it was longer because it does not go all the way to my feet. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and ordered the 60\xe2\x80\x9d pillow. Sleeping much more and more comfortably now that I have this support for back and belly. Wish the pillow case for this pillow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so expensive, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I ended up getting it too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 23 weeks now and this pillow definitely helps a lot on keeping me sleep well at night. It\xe2\x80\x99s large and soft. The U sharp design replaced multiple pillows I had to have. I like it a lot.'
b'This is the most comfortable pillow ever! It\xe2\x80\x99s soft and cozy and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me too hot. I love that there is support in the front and back it makes it much easier to find a comfortable sleeping position, and turn from side to side at night. I was previously a back sleeper before I became pregnant and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable. This pillow has been a life saver. It takes up half of our queen size bed but my husband snuggles up to it as well'
b"Best pillow ever. I've never slept better"
b"I bought this pillow, not because I was pregnant, but because I have frozen shoulder.  No matter which way I turned, I would need to move the pillows surrounding me to support the shoulder.  Pillows were dropping all over the place and I had trouble sleeping for more than a couple of hours at a time.  I bought this pillow and have drastically reduced the number of pillows I need at night and can now regularly sleep through the night, It also replaces the pillow I had to support my knees while sleeping.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is currently suffering from the same problem. We are both 5'11' and the larger size pillow option was wonderful since most of these types of pillows only support shorter people."
b'For my wife this was a lifesaver. She had a regular body pillow that while very comfortable pre pregnancy didn\xe2\x80\x99t cut the mustard during. She said the curve that goes around your neck was the difference. It aligned her body well.'
b'I dont know what I did without this pillow before pregnancy. I will use this after pregnancy too. My Hubby likes it too! Good quality and its great that you can wash the cover. Worth the price. Its great on the bed for sleeping and great on the couch to just be comfortable.'
b"This pillow is amazing. It supports my back and my belly. My hips and my back don't hurt as bad when I wake up in the morning.  I wish I would have bought this pillow sooner.  It's really nice. I'd definitely recommend it."

b'I am not pregnant. I deal with fibro and RA pain in my shoulder blade.1. It came squished, but fluffed very quickly. I actually took a nap with it about an hour after and it was so comfy and then later it fluffed more!2. That nap - OMGosh! The best sleep I have gotten in years! I suffer fibromyalgia and do not take pain medication. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable and sleep is key, but it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible. Not with this baby!!!3. It is giant, but oddly not. We have a queen bed and my partner is a big sleeper. This pillow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt her takeover. She is able to spread out and I am able to still sleep comfortable. We I am cuddled in it we (the pillow and I) still take less space than a twin size bed.4. At this price I figure if it stays fluffy for five or six months I am happy. We spend money on so many things these days - sleep is def worth the investment. If I do have to replace I will update and let you know when. (I will also convert the old pillow to a dog bed because my big dogs are obsessed.)'
b"First of all I am not pregnant... I have been told I need hip replacement surgery, knee replacement surgery and have had neck surgery and back surgery but due to a car wreck I've been advised additional surgery would be necessary. Anyhow my nights are very long, sleepless and painful. I have found God's Word is helping more than anything regarding healing but as I'm learning how to receive my healing... this pillow is absolutely AMAZING!!! I can move it into a million different positions to relieve pain and also restless leg syndrome. I love that the outer cover is removable so I can wash it. Also the cover is great quality it's thick...almost as thick as a sweatshirt."
b'I have shoulder and back problems from lifting a 95 lbs disabled person all day. I have tried muscle relaxers, physical therapy, and was talking about injections with my doctor. I decided to procrastinate and get this pillow to see if it would properly support me while I sleep so everything could relax and repair while I slept. I\'m so glad I did! I got made fun of for buying a "pregnancy pillow" but it was able to keep my shoulders at the proper position AND let me tuck the "arms" behind my knees to help my back (side note I am 5\'2) . This pillow (in addition to meds and physical therapy) has ceased the need for the injections. Even if you aren\'t pregnant, this is a GREAT support pillow! It\'s firm enough to keep its shape but squishy enough that it\'s soft and perfectly cuddly.'
b"Hi. I'm 14 weeks pregnant with my third baby. Have a new amazing tempurpedic cool technology mattress (which I normally sleep great on) and two $200 pillows. I though this pregnancy I will sleep like a baby! Nope! Along with my bump showing up earlier so did all my aches and pains and bedtime restlessness. His pillow didn't have too many reviews but I wanted the grey jersey fabric cover. I swear no matter what my position on this thing I feel great. I sleep better and my butt got smaller (just kidding). When I read I put another pillow under the head part and it's so comfy. I'm actually terrified that something will happen to it and came back here to think about ordering a backup just incase. Oh and it's not too huge like some of the other ones I was looking at. It's great all around."
b"I cannot say enough good things about this body pillow. Once I hit 3.5 months pregnant, I was having major trouble falling asleep. I have a broken back that, combined with the usual aches and pains of pregnancy, made it nearly impossible for me to find a comfortable sleeping position. It would seriously take me 3-4 hours to fall asleep at night. I ordered this body pillow, and every night I've fallen asleep within 3-5 minutes of getting in bed. The firmness is enough that it supports my back and neck no matter which position I choose to sleep in, and I'm finally able to fall asleep quickly and sleep through the night. I also love that it comes with a cover that makes it easy to wash, because I swear I can smell EVERYTHING these days so I always need everything to be super clean. I would highly recommend this body pillow to anyone with back pains or pregnancy insomnia!"
b"I have been using this pillow for almost 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with it.  At 12 weeks pregnant, I already felt uncomfortable sleeping on my back (I have really low blood pressure) and switched to side sleeping.  I tried putting a pillow between my knees but that only helped a bit so I decided to look into getting a pregnancy pillow early (I love my sleep).  I am amazed at how much this pillow help me... having one side to lean against with my back or one side with my stomach allow me to make small adjustments (like straightening my legs out more or one completely out plus shifting the weight from just one point on my hip to more on my butt or thighs) that seem to make all the difference in my sleep quality.  When I was doing the one pillow between my leg thing, I would wake up 4 times a night to shift or would wake up on my back, this pillow solves all of that.  I still wake up once to pee, but that just comes with the territory.Also of importance, this pillow was clean and odorless as soon as I pulled it out of it's packaging... no chemical/factory smell.  The pillow case is nice and soft.  And I was worried that I wouldn't like the head support since I'm slightly picky when it comes to pillow, but it is perfectly comfortable so I had zero trouble adjusting.  This is all upside, ladies, so treat yourself and get this pillow sooner than later!"
b"I'm 25 weeks pregnant and really enjoying this pillow! I'm normally a back/stomach sleeper so I've been really struggling to sleep comfortably on my side. I first purchased the Snoogle after a friend recommended it. I wanted to love it, it was great quality. But I could not get past the shape. My head wasn't comfortable and I didn't like having to flip it over in the middle of the night if I changed sides. THIS however, is like a hug all night long! I can change sides comfortably without struggling to flip the pillow. I would probably rate quality itself as a 4- it's not bad, but doesn't feel quite as high quality as the Snoogle. However, it is comfortable and I am sleeping far better with this! It makes it easier to fall and stay asleep, so 5 stars from this pregnant lady!! Highly recommend.Update: I am now 35 weeks pregnant and am more thankful for this pillow than ever. It's the only reason that I sleep at all these days. Best purchase I've made in a long time (which is saying a lot because I've bought a lot here lately!!)."
b'I don\'t know what possessed me to buy this pillow, I saw it and thought "wow that looks comfy"! I was right, it is comfy and I absolutely love it. I am WAY past the child bearing age so I recommend it to anyone male or female who wants a good nights sleep. It\'s snugly and comfortable and so far has kept it loft and shape. My 15 year old grandson loves to lay on my bed and watch TV while laying inside it. Last night my 7 year old granddaughter spent the night and wanted to sleep with it. She loved it so much that she asked me to get one for her in pink. You can still move around and change sides without difficulty. I use it and one bed pillow under my head without any stiff neck what\'s so ever.'
b"Update:I used this pillow after my hips started to bother me very early on in my pregnancy.I don't think you need to be pregnant to use this. Actually I wish I would have used it years ago.But it definitely worked for my hip discomfort. And as I am about to give birth soon, I can say it works wonderfully in the third trimester. Zero regrets for getting this product. A definite must have in pregnancy.The company does not use flame retardants or chemicals in their pillows. This is something few people think about. You should. Especially when you start buying baby products (clothes especially polyester is a problem, car seat, bassinets, crib mattress, etc) because of the scientific data that details the negative health effects of these chemicals in our babies. Do your research. For adults mattresses and pillows are where we get exposed to flame retardants the most.Anyways, I contacted the company directly and they send me this:Thank you  for your reply. None of our pillows use flame retardants and/or chemicals, you could use it with confidence.Please contact us anytime if you have any questions.Have a nice day!Best regards,AngQiOriginal Review:I have been using this for a bit. I have to say this has made a huge difference in the quality of my sleep. I am able to find a comfortable position easily and at some point you have to sleep sideways when you're preggo and this helps with that! My hips also don't hurt as much while sleeping. But I have preggo induced hip soreness so no pillow or gadget will fix that. However, this pillow is amazing! Even my significant other tries to steal it from me. Good luck to him >=)."
b"Very, very pleased with this pregnancy pillow!  I had purchased a different U-shaped pillow late in my last pregnancy that I loved (wish I had ordered sooner!), but it didn't come with a removable/washable cover.  These pillows take up a lot of space, so I got rid of it shortly after I stoped nursing.  As soon as I found I was expecting again, I placed my order for this pillow.  So glad I did!  I purchased the 55 inch U-shaped full body with the jersey knit cotton cover.  Package came vacuum sealed and the pillow popped right up upon opening.  It's a very full pillow (which I absolutely love) and gives great back support.  I removed the cover that was easy to replace back on after being washed and dried.  I'm petite at 5' and the 55 inch size fits me just right.  Love the light, soft jersey cover and grey color.  Highly recommend!"
b'I myself am not pregnant but am a side sleeper. I find myself able to get comfortable faster as opposed to tossing and turning to find that restful position. My boyfriend enjoys it as well and I find him somehow "ending up in it." I\'m 5\'2" him 5\'5". I feel like it\'s a great length whereas you can adjust the arms into multiple positions with ease . Poofy, firm, dense, and comfortable!! Quality hasn\'t failed. I like all the accessibility you get with removable cover and ability to adjust filling to your liking. I\'m glad I chose this brand after shopping around. I\'ve bought two more for my sister\'s.'
b'I am 6mon pregnant and was unable to sleep well at night. Tried to use an extra pillow to help support my belly but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work that well. My belly is not big comparing to most of the moms, but I felt gassy and my back hurts occasionally. I feel extremely satisfied after using this pillow - it feels like .... sleeping on the cloud. I temoved all other pillows in my bed, put my head on the U shaped area and snuggle with the legs. So comfy!The only thing I feel a bit awkward is to put the pillow back to the pillow case after I washed the case. The legs are bulky and it takes some time to squeeze them in the case.'
b"After reading all the reviews for all the U-shaped body pillow I jumped out the window and bought this one and DEFINITELY made the right decision. It's not too bulky doesn't take up all the space in our queen size bed. Definitely has volume, if it flattens out I will update my review."
b'Expecting mommas, I received my angel pregnancy pillow yesterday and let me tell you, I slept so good last night! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been sleeping more than a few hours in a night due to RLS, bad dreams, or just constant tossing and turning. This pillow is able to support your belly, which I had issues with using just a regular pillow. But I woke up this morning feeling good, bed still partially made and doggy on the bed.(he\xe2\x80\x99s been sleeping on the floor with my constant flipping and turning.) I would HIGHLY recommend one if your having issues sleeping. I got mine off amazon, but they are in stores too! Hopefully this helps another soon to be zombie momma like myself.'
b"I'm a massage therapist and I purchased this for use with my prenatal clients. I use it conjunction with a wedge pillow. My clients refer to it as the cocoon, or sometimes the moat. I tested out my own set up and let me tell you, it's super cozy! It provides just enough back support and neck support, and let's you flip easily from side to side without having to drag a full body pillow with you. The cover is a full cotton jersey with a nice stretch, and replacements are available so I can have multiple covers and use one while the other is soiled. So far, the oil I use has only done minimal staining."
b"This pillow saved me! I was not sleeping AT ALL. Tossing, turning couldn't get comfortable. I am not pregnant, I just needed additional support for my back which this provides and has helped ease hip and leg aches. It also keeps me in one spot so I don't wake myself up constantly moving around, but allows me to easily maneuver if I need too and I fall right back to sleep. My dogs love it too. I will often find them snuggled up in the middle of it under the blanket. Have no issue with the fluff. I throw it in the dryer every other time I wash the cover and flip it over often sleeping on both sides."
b'You need one of these! This is seriously The Best purchase I have made for pregnancy. I am on my fourth pregnancy and wished I would have gotten this sooner. It makes sleeping so much more comfortable. I love that it has side support, and back support.  My legs haven\'t gotten charlie horses since they are popped up a bit. I have had it for a few month now and a 30 weeks.  Sleep is getting tougher, but I can\'t imagine getting much without this pillow!I am excited to try it out later with nursing.Cover comes off, so easy to wash. Comfortabl3 and good length for my 5\'11" frame'
b'This is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on or with....that includes my husband (sorry babe).  I am not pregnant but I do have chronic pain in my right shoulder from the way I contort myself at night.  The flexibility of this pillow provides cozy support like you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe and just from the time I have spent snuggled up tonight, napping and reading; I can already feel a difference. I feel like I will need to start bringing a separate suitcase for it on my business trips!  Tonight will be my first full night sleeping on it, so I will report in more as an update.  Oh and P.s.  it\xe2\x80\x99s BIG!!  We have a king size bed so it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.  But it def takes up the space of a flexible, squishy person.  Be aware of that.'
b"Why did I wait so long to buy this?!?! I tossed and turned all night long for several months during my pregnancy and finally bought it when I was 6 months along. I still have to roll over and get readjusted a few times during the night but it has helped me so much. I didn't like the use it like the picture shows. I like my pillow so I use it upside down (like a U) and it works great. My husband is also happy I'm not moving so much at night and waking him up in the process! I was afraid it would take over our queen sized bed but it really doesn't. My husband has plenty of room on his side still."
b"I bought this for my wife that is 9 weeks pregnant and was really struggling to get comfortable enough to really get some rest. I bought this pillow for her birthday and she has commented how comfortable it is and how she has slept more now with it because she can get comfortable and get some sleep. I read the reviews and she hasn't commented that it goes flat at all. I did open the vacuum bag it came in and let the pillow expand but about an hour after I opened the packaging I washed and dried the pillow. It was very fluffy and full after I did so. I would recommend buying this pillow to help you sleep"

b'Absolutely Amazing!This review is coming from a woman with multiple joint problems including subluxing neck, shoulders, hips and spine. I have purchased every known neck and support pillow, including body pillows, known to man, and have never found one that works all by itself. After buying an adjustable bed I still had 8 pillows on my side...and carried these from room to room to sew, read or watch TV...then back to bed they came. I took a chance and bought the Meiz U Shaped Pillow after reading the reviews and comparing it to similar pillows...and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I did!  Being a side sleeper and using this pillow, there is no readjusting pillows whenever I turn over. The long arms bend to provide arm, shoulder and knee support, and I no longer need a head pillow. The 8 pillows I used to use?...in the closet. The long arms and back provide support in my favorite chair to elevate my books or sewing. The side arms support arms and elbows; the top of the U prevents my back from resting on an uncomfortable surface. The microfiber cover is soft; the stuffing is also soft yet supports very gently. It\xe2\x80\x99s big...but if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide the support for your limbs from head to toe. A big plus for me was the washable cover came with the pillow; with most other pillows the covers were $20+ extra. I\xe2\x80\x99m not being paid to say these things...I\xe2\x80\x99m just so happy I finally found what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for - for decades!'
b"I'm a man and I bought this to use during my second round of chemotherapy. During my last round I was prone to muscle fatigue and joint pain which made a good night's sleep a challenge. One of the best positions was lying on my side, but 'leaning' back slightly to alleviate pressure on my hip joint. Trying to place regular pillows was difficult as one would always slip or compress more than the others. Knowing this in advance I looked for alternatives and stumbled across this pillow. This pillow gives me support from my head and neck to my calves that is consistent.It also helps to be able to place on leg on the side like the lady in the picture is doing. I know that looks like an awkward pose for joint pain, but it works for me. My only suggestion would be to offer this with a cover that is 100% cotton. The plushy microfiber material doesn't breath well and another of my my chemo side effects is an issue regulating my body temperature consistently. My dog likes it, too. I've had to send her to her own pillow a few times. She seems okay with that option."
b"This is the BEST investment I've ever made for my sleep! I know this is a maternity pillow, but I am not pregnant. I just got tired of trying to place pillows between my knees, under my neck & head, etc. I'd bought a regular body pillow but it wasn't doing the trick. This pillow saved the day...and my sleep! I've slept more soundly with this pillow than I have in ages!"
b"I got this for my expecting wife because she is having problem sleeping at night. The first night sleeping with it, she was instantly in love with it. Her pains and discomforts is gone and now she wouldn't sleep without it. She is 5'2 and it fits her perfectly."
b"It is so great for pregnancy and worth every penny.  It is sooooooo soft too.  The head support was a little too thick for my neck, but I ended up flipping it, so that the head part is by my feet now and I'm just using my regular pillow.  But I am finicky about my pillows for my neck.I normally do not sleep on my side, so this helped me a lot to adapt to it.  It is great if you toss and turn too because it is not hard to readjust compared to the one sided pillows or just normal pillows."
b"I'm a little over 6 weeks, going on 7, and ever since I found out i was pregnant a few weeks ago, my lower back has been killing me. It was a big symptom i would have prior to getting my period, but this has been constant. I'm a chronic back and stomach sleeper & although that's ok to do for right now, my back just wasn't having it anymore. Sleeping on my side was really difficult to get used to and my back never seemed to get the support i needed now matter how many cushions i used. I got this in yesterday, and WOW! This is a life changer. I zoned out so fast once I got situated and it's perfectly firm. Don't need any extra pillows for my head. This is all you need. I was scared about the reviews of the size, but I'm happy to report that this is perfectly situated on my side of the bed & doesn't disturb my husband and we have a queen. Don't hesitate! Invest in your sleep before your bundle of joy arrives!"
b"This is a review from someone who is NOT pregnant, & also not paid to write this review..  My dog wasn't paid either!This pillow is mainly the only reason I have slept after my car accident.. I had a slipped disc, bulging disc, misaligned spine and neck. Slightly dislocated hip and I was tossing and turning for hours, unable to get comfortable in any position. No matter how many pillows were on my bed (at least 5) I could not find a position that would allow me to stay still for more than 5 minutes. I was a walking zombie 3 days after my accident and then I was doing reviews on pregnancy pillows AND I AM SO GLAD I DID.This pillow is so comfortable, very durable.. I've tossed this in and out of my car and house for when i'm sleeping at my boyfriends, etc. and it has kept its shape and is still as comfortable as the first day I got it!The packaging was awesome and it took it's shape within minutes. I don't even think that I will ever go back to my original $160 pillow! Even after I am fully recovered. THAT'S how great this pillow is.If you're on the fence, just buy the pillow. You won't regret it!Side note: You should make one half the size for dogs.. Mine steals my pillow the second he is in the bed alone!"
b'Love the pillow, hate the velvet (fuzzy) cover. Yes it\xe2\x80\x99s soft, but it makes me sweat! Thankfully I found a replacement cover that fits!-Ang Qi Stretch Jersey Pregnancy Pillowcase - Total Body/Maternity Pillow Replacement Cover - U Shaped Pillowcase - Fit 55" x 31" Pillows - Gray-I found it by using the pillow\xe2\x80\x99s measurements. The pillow gives great support. I have a queen size bed, and it takes up basically my side of the bed.'
b"Love it! I'm not pregnant, but always use a ton of pillows so my husband got this for me and it's perfect!"
b"I was afraid this would be a flat, scratchy, pillow that didn't provide much support but as my pregnancy has been chasing a lot of discomfort at night and I keep ending up sleeping on my back which isn't good for baby. This pillow is awesome and I was completely blown away!!It fluffed up into a thick, fluffy pillow that became pretty firm after a few minutes, in a good way, and the pillow case is actually very soft and delicate.It's a huge pillow...like bigger than me and takes up half our queen sized bed (poor husband) but I have slept wonderfully with my growing belly. The curves in the shape allow it to support my back, belly, and hips all while providing a supportive pillow for my neck. I don't use any other pillows now and don't find myself waking up on my back anymore as the full body support keeps me from rolling too much.Definitely worth the price!!"
b'One of the most comfortable pillows I have.  I have tried numerous pillows to include "My Pillow" and this is the first pillow that I didn\'t wake up the next morning with soreness in my back and neck.  If you are a tall person (more than 5\'8") I would recommend the longer one.  While it did lose some of the firmness after several nights....I plan to just add more stuffing to fluff it back up.'
b'Ever since I bought this body pillow about 6 months ago, it is a joy to jump in bed at night or for a nap.  Even when I make a trip out of town and I drive, the pillow goes with me. I wish I could take it with me when I fly and just say it is a big neck pillow.  I think I could sleep on the floor and still be comfortable with this pillow.  I got it with the plush velour gray cover.  The cover is very soft to touch to add even more comfort.  I called the company to let them know I wanted to buy a second gray velour cover to use while I wash the first one and they gave me a code to get a discount on the second cover.  I cannot say how much I love this pillow because it puts me in heaven when it cradles me.  I have an old injury in my right hip that used to wake me up at night with pain.  This pillow cushions every part of my body so I never wake up at night with pain any longer.  When I sit up to read or watch TV or videos on my Kindle Fire, I prop the body pillow up against a TV pillow at the head of my bed and the comfort is exhilarating.  I cannot say how much I love this pillow and for the price, it cannot be beaten!'
b"Best pillow ever! I'm not pregnant, but my husband goes out of town a lot for work. I have a hard time sleeping with such an empty bed that I always put a body pillow right behind me to help me sleep. This pillow is so comfortable that now I can rest a little easier while he's gone. The pillow cover is very soft and the pillow was nicely filled (no empty sections). I know it'll be great next time I'm pregnant. It's a little high for my neck for sleeping, but I just flip it around and put the bottom up by my face so I can sleep with my regular pillow."
b'I\'m 5\'3", slim/petite build and almost 5 months pregnant. This pillow is a life saver! I wasn\'t sleeping through the night until I got this pillow to support my legs, back and belly. Its soft, plush, and perfectly proportioned to the body. I\'ve used it with my pillow and without at the headrest and both are comfortable. Since I can only sleep on my side now this has been such a relief - I can wrap my body around this pillow and get the support both me and the baby need to sleep comfortably.Even my husband has considered swiping this from me a few times :)Note: It comes with a very plush fleece-like pillow case. It doesn\'t make me too hot but I can imagine some people would want a diff type of pillow case.'
b'Okay so I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even a female. I have to sleep with something between my legs, usually a pillow or balled up blankets. I have really bad knee pain and hip discomfort the next day if I don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep that way. This pillow was perfect and super comfy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can ever do without it now. Wifey was super jealous the next morning because I hugged the pillow more than I hugged her. We both share the pillow now so she can feel loved too. Very versatile pillow.'
b'This is my fourth pregnancy I wish I found this pillow five years ago. It gives awesome support for your legs, belly, and back. Finally getting some rest! Its very soft and not too thick because I found with previous pregnancy pillows I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up with aches in my neck. I would definitely even use this even after pregnancy it\xe2\x80\x99s such a comfortable pillow that gives a ton of body support!'
b"This pillow is amazing!!!!!! I am a big stomach sleeper & it causes so much pain to my back. Especially when I first wake up. I do my workouts in the morning & with sleeping on my stomach all night, it causes a tweak in my back, so it takes about 10-15 mins to really be able to start going hard in my workout & I'm still careful. I did not buy this pillow because I am pregnant in anyway, I bought it to keep me from flipping onto my stomach at night. It works like charm! The velvet cover is soooo soft & amazing & doesn't make me hot at night either. If you need to stop sleeping on your stomach, GET THIS PILLOW. Most comfortable sleep ever."
b'I just received this yesterday so I used it for the first time last night.I am absolutely amazed! I have had a weird leg pain off and on for at least 5 years, starts at the hip and goes down to my knee. It has something to do with lateral movement. When I lay down I notice it a lot more since I sleep on my side. I try to use a pillow under my knee but it doesnt stay put so it is a constant struggle. The comfort that this "u" shaped pillow provides is unbelievable! I slept so well last night and sitting up to watch tv or work on the computer is much more comfy too. Everyone should use one of these because I think you would all benefit from it. Very pleased with my purchase! Might make these a Christmas present for family members next Christmas!'
b"This pillow is perfect for anyone looking for more comfort in bed. It's lightweight and so super soft that I don't want to leave it!"
b'Since unwrapping this pillow today, I can honestly say this is the most comfortable I have been in a while! I\xe2\x80\x99m very early in my pregnancy, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper, and my hips have been very sore lately. Top it off with the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bad cold, this pillow is a God-send for me right now! Super lightweight and very soft! Only concern I have is that the cover seems a little flimsy. Easy enough fix to hand-stitch if the zipper comes loose. So worth the money to be comfortable!!'

b'This was loaned to me due to the fact I have a shattered spine that is essentially discintegrated. I need a lot of support while sleeping to get thru the night. I have never quite had what I would call pain free rest. Until this pillow......wow is an understatement. I can wrap this thing around and thru in a way it fully supports me. That moment of realization you feel no pressure...is when you fall asleep and get rested. I will buy again.'
b"Bought it at the end of my first trimester, and begrudgingly so. I was skeptical of spending this much money on a pillow. I WAS WRONG. This pillow is so fantastic that I have given her a name. I regret nothing. The length is great (I'm 5'9 so I'm tall) and the cover is SO SOFT. Love that is can be removed and washed really easily to, but I haven't actually washed it yet so I can't really say how it washes up. I love her and cannot imagine sleeping through my pregnancy without her."
b"I cant even explain how much I love this pillow. I bought 4 pregnancy pillows before I decided on this one. I am 3 months pregnant and even if I wasn't, I would still love this pillow. It has the perfect amount of firmness, and is just sooo comfortable! I feel like I am sleeping much better with this pillow. I bought another one to try but am not even going to bother with it, since I have been so comfortable with this one. I do with it was a little longer, but that is just because I am tall and its my preference, but honestly..it is fine how it is and works great. Love my new pillow!"
b"This is the best sleep I've had in a very long time! This pillow is a life saver. I ordered the extra long pillow with the removable cover. I got exactly that and it's exceeded my expectations. I'm not pregnant....long past that phase in my life. However, I do sleep on my side for the most part and usually have my head slightly elevated. I have gone from waking up multiple times in the night to readjust pillows that have slipped out of place to sleeping all the way through the night without having to make adjustments. The pillow is slightly firmer than what I was used to but it offers great support and keeps me from rolling onto my back and off the pillows. Love it!"
b'The best pregnancy pillow ever! This is the second pillow I got from Ang Qi. My husband after using my 55 inch one loved it so much I ordered him a longer one! I love the jersey cover because it is so easy to take off and put back on. My sister-in-law got a different pillow when she got pregnant and it was a pain to wash the cover because it was so difficult to take off and put back on. The jersey cover it came with is stretchy so it eliminates that problem completely. The cover is also very soft and keeps me cool during the hot summer nights! I absolutely love this pillow and would recommend it to anyone (not just pregnant women) who is in need of a body pillow!  (Even our dog loves the pillow!!)'
b"I'm 5'9'' and this pillow has changed my entire course of sleep, in a good way!! Like most, I wish I would've ordered this pillow when my pump started to show. I cannot sleep without this pillow! I have tried and it's hell! Lol! I am now 33 1/2 weeks pregnant and it's the only thing that helps me get through the night! When we travel to my mom's my boyfriend already knows that we are not to leave the house without that pillow or it will be a VERY long unpleasant weekend. Lol! I recommend this pillow to all pregnant and non pregnant women and folks alike!"
b'Do not look any further! This pillow is fantastic, the cover is so soft and its the perfect amount of support. I researched a ton of these and finally decided on this. I am 21 weeks pregnant but I have been having a hard time sleeping without hip pain for a few weeks. This was 100% solved by this pillow. I look forward to going home and curling up inside of it. Even my husband is jealous!'
b'Love love love it. Should have bought one of these 15 years ago'
b'So happy with my purchase! I\xe2\x80\x99m 6 months pregnant and have been using this body pillow for about a month and a half now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sleeping much better at night. This is my second pregnancy. I used the C shaped body pillow for my first pregnancy, and I think this pillow is much more comfortable. I ordered the gray velvet pillow cover and have no regrets! It\xe2\x80\x99s so soft, great pillow! It\xe2\x80\x99s also narrower than other similar pillows that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, which gives my husband more room on his side in our queen size bed.'
b'This pillow is a (preggo) lifesaver!! At 22 weeks pregnant, the aches and pains started setting in - waking me up and causing me to limp out of bed in the morning. I tried pillows on every angle...in front, back, between the legs, etc., without relief. After two weeks of misery, I ordered this pillow, and have slept soundly and painfree ever since!Length is also a bonus! I am 6\xe2\x80\x991\xe2\x80\x9d and while I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a surplus of length in this pillow, I am able to put the ends between my knees. The name brand pillow that I tried in store was not long enough for this. I do find that I still need 1 extra pillows for the legs to feel well enough supported.I am slightly worried about how long the stuffing will hold up, but for now I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a cloud.'

b'This pillow has taken away all of my nighttime hip pain! I am sleeping SO much better with this pillow. The snoogle was not fluffy enough to provide support and because its shaped like a "C", every time I turned, Id have to turn it with me, pain. This pillow being shaped like a U, just stays in place as I move around and it is much more full, so it seems to provide better support and also keep me from rolling totally flat on my back. Love.'
b'This pillow is so great! 2nd pregnancy and I have given up the stacked pillow fort of the old days. It is very cozy and comfortable- just wish it was longer because it does not go all the way to my feet. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and ordered the 60\xe2\x80\x9d pillow. Sleeping much more and more comfortably now that I have this support for back and belly. Wish the pillow case for this pillow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so expensive, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I ended up getting it too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 23 weeks now and this pillow definitely helps a lot on keeping me sleep well at night. It\xe2\x80\x99s large and soft. The U sharp design replaced multiple pillows I had to have. I like it a lot.'
b'This is the most comfortable pillow ever! It\xe2\x80\x99s soft and cozy and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me too hot. I love that there is support in the front and back it makes it much easier to find a comfortable sleeping position, and turn from side to side at night. I was previously a back sleeper before I became pregnant and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable. This pillow has been a life saver. It takes up half of our queen size bed but my husband snuggles up to it as well'
b"Best pillow ever. I've never slept better"
b"I bought this pillow, not because I was pregnant, but because I have frozen shoulder.  No matter which way I turned, I would need to move the pillows surrounding me to support the shoulder.  Pillows were dropping all over the place and I had trouble sleeping for more than a couple of hours at a time.  I bought this pillow and have drastically reduced the number of pillows I need at night and can now regularly sleep through the night, It also replaces the pillow I had to support my knees while sleeping.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is currently suffering from the same problem. We are both 5'11' and the larger size pillow option was wonderful since most of these types of pillows only support shorter people."
b'For my wife this was a lifesaver. She had a regular body pillow that while very comfortable pre pregnancy didn\xe2\x80\x99t cut the mustard during. She said the curve that goes around your neck was the difference. It aligned her body well.'
b'I dont know what I did without this pillow before pregnancy. I will use this after pregnancy too. My Hubby likes it too! Good quality and its great that you can wash the cover. Worth the price. Its great on the bed for sleeping and great on the couch to just be comfortable.'
b"This pillow is amazing. It supports my back and my belly. My hips and my back don't hurt as bad when I wake up in the morning.  I wish I would have bought this pillow sooner.  It's really nice. I'd definitely recommend it."

b'I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.My wife was having trouble sleeping since becoming pregnant and purchased the regular sized Queen Rose U Shaped pillow, from which she greatly benefits. It supports her to sleep on either side, which she had a hard time doing before as she is usually a back sleeper and stacking up pillows does not have the same effect. Immediately seeing how it could benefit me as well, I decided to try the King Size pillow (being over 6\xe2\x80\x99 tall, the regular size wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long enough).Laying flat with each side even and straight, the full size of the pillow is about 33\xe2\x80\x9d wide and 64\xe2\x80\x9d long, with each side about 10\xe2\x80\x9d wide. It is well made, soft, and feels nice. The removable cover is a useful feature.The pillow is quite large and if you are sharing a bed with a partner, you will likely want to have at least a queen size bed. If both partners have a pillow, a king size bed is recommended (we didn\xe2\x80\x99t fit too well when we both tried them on our old queen, but we were already upgrading to a split king anyway, so it worked out). If you are sleeping alone, a twin bed will work.I have been using the pillow for a few weeks now and really like it. Being a side sleeper who used to sleep with a second pillow between my legs, it offers support on each side so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have switch the pillow back and forth. It also provides a natural place for both arms, which has always been an issue. I feel better when waking up in the morning (I have persistent shoulder, back, and neck pain) so there may be some pain reduction benefits, although as mentioned above we purchased a new bed around the same time, so it is hard to tell which one is making the difference (I suspect both are contributing). I did use it a few days on our old bed and felt better than with my old pillow. It is too soon to tell whether there will be any long-term pain reduction, although sleeping in more functional positions is a step in the right direction.There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether to purchase a body pillow and which one to choose. This King Size is better for those who are taller or want to manipulate the pillow in various positions. It is softer and the inner material is adjustable by design. This can be a good feature, but also a potential drawback as it can be challenging to get everything just right, although I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found it to be too big of an issue, as I like that I can move in various positions at night and adjust the pillow accordingly with minimal effort. My wife tried the King Size and found it comfortable, but prefers the firmer, shorter (she\xe2\x80\x99s 5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d) pillow. If anyone wants a longer, firmer pillow, additional material could easily be added to the King Size, as there is a opening with a zipper at the top of the pillow.Overall, the Queen Rose pillows are high quality and do what they are supposed to, providing a good option for pregnant and non-pregnant sleepers, female and male (if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t bothered by the odd looks you\xe2\x80\x99ll get when telling people you bought a pregnancy pillow). Having never used a body pillow, my wife and I are very satisfied, although with no basis for comparison, I cannot say whether a cheaper body pillow would offer the same of similar benefits. For pregnancy, it is definitely a worthwhile purchase.'
b"Fits me perfectly and I'm not pregnant.  I feel like I am wrapped up in a cloud.  I'm a side sleeper with bottom leg straight and top leg bent; bottom arm usually under the pillow.  I've always had headaches, neck and shoulder pain from pillows that flatten out or are too thick.  Recently, I started getting bad hip pain and chiropractor recommended a pillow to keep top knee elevated.  Using a regular pillow was cumbersome as was the smaller knee pillows with an elastic strap to attach to one knee, resulting in sleep disruptions every time I tried to turn over.  This U-shaped pillow is perfect for me.  No more headaches, neck, shoulder and hip pain after the first night of use.  The stuffing is firm enough that it doesn't flatten out under my head and knees.  I find I'm sleeping much more soundly and don't wake up during the night just to turn over.  The first night, the outside pillow leg did fall off the bed but I must have figured out how to flip over without pushing it off because it hasn't happened since.  So far, I have not had any problems being too hot, which was an initial concern.  I'm totally thrilled with my purchase and highly recommend this pillow."
b"I was hesitant to order this pillow because it seemed to focus more on pregnant women, than any other people.  About 6 months ago I started waking up with horrendous lower back pain.  One time it took me 30 minutes to even make it to the bathroom because of the pain.  Once I was able to move in a vertical position my pain would work its way out and I was fine.  At home I started sleeping on my sofa where I did not have this problem.  When visiting my son's family, out of state, I began to have the same problem.  I purchased the bed I slept in a few years ago and was surprised to suddenly have this same thing happen after years of sleeping in the bed.  I decided I needed to get off my sofa and back to my bed so I made the purchase.  I also bought a pillow case.  The pillow case was more difficult to put on but eventually I tried the pillow out.  I woke up the next morning without any lower back pain.  After a couple of days, I decided to sleep without it again (sort of a test).  Again I had lower back pain, not severe, but it was there. This morning I went back onto Amazon and ordered another pillow and pillow case and it will be delivered to my son's house. My first thought when the back problems started was the bed.  I have an air bed at home so I can adjust the hardness very easily.  I finally decided the problem was I tossed and turned too much and this put a strain on my lower back.  When I slept on the sofa I could not toss and move around which prevented the strain on my back. So even if you are not pregnant, I gave this pillow a definite 5 stars"
b"excellent quality, great stuffing, and while I need to fluff it back after a couple nights sleep, I suppose no other pillow can get away without fluffing. The quality is very good on this and the pillow case was easy to clean and reapply. the instructions are very clear (no washing the inner pillow, hang dry the case) and this really is much more comfortable than the moonlight slumber comfort u pillow. In particular, this pillow does a better job of hugging me and supporting my legs than the comfort u. I found the comfort u was too wide and the support was almost nil after a couple nights. it didn't fluff back up either. The Queen Rose u pillow has held up AWESOMELY for over a month already."
b'If I could give this pillow 10 million stars I would!! I am 55 years old and have scoliosis. I have been chasing chiropractors and physical therapists around for the past year with chronic daily low back, mid back, and neck pain. If one area didn\'t hurt the other ones did. I even tried sleeping on the floor for a few weeks. I bought this pillow for my pregnant daughter in law when she came to visit. When she left, I tried it. I have only used it 2 nights and this is the first time in over a year that I have not hurt during sleep and after. I was even able to sleep on my back (am normally a side sleeper) as the pillow "hugged" my sides and I bent the legs of it beneath my knees to relieve low back pressure. So comfy and comforting. I bought this one because the "legs" of it are longer than most of the others and I need support for my lower leg all the way down to my foot when sleeping on my side. I do bolster the head area with a small flat pillow, but will be going to the craft store to buy more filling. It is great without it though. I like that you can add more stuffing to suit your needs. Oh, and it did well for my pregnant daughter in law too. I am 5\'7". It is plenty long.'
b'Absolutely perfect. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s long enough to rest between both my knees and feet. That\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find. Yes my knees are bent a bit but nothing crazy. Who sleeps straight on their side anyway? This pillow has done wonders for my SI joint pain. I recently learned that sleeping on your side without a pillow between your knees really inflamed that joint and makes the pain worse. Now I sleep with this and have been pain free for two weeks. And it\xe2\x80\x99s great that I can hug it too. Or if I roll onto my back, I just put it under my knees to avoid angering that SI joint in that position. This pillow has worked miracles for me. My low back pain was ruining my life and now I am able to sleep so much better and I feel so much better in the morning. I also like that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to move the pillow if you turn over on the other side. And if you need a little support to lean you back against, works great for that too. Seriously worth the money. And it\xe2\x80\x99s very fluffy, took a couple days to fluff up fully like the little note from the company said. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more than full enough to be supportive. But it now!!'
b"I have slept with this since I got it. I have had 2 discectomy surgeries on my back, have residual pain and suffer from back tremors. With this pillow, I eliminated two side pillows, one for my feet, and one for my head. I still use one foam pillow, because I like my head more elevated when I sleep. I got the gray pillow, which is like a velure fabric. Honestly, would have loved this even more if the pillow case had been a jersey t-shirt knit, because it is very hot sometimes to sleep with. I will probably pick up a jersey sheet at a garage sale or thrift store to make one or two. I don't wake up as much at night in discomfort, toss and turn a lot less, and can position myself easier. My husband hates it, but admits I sleep better. We have a queen bed, so he thinks I take up too much room, but I feel it is still about half. This has saved me from begging my husband for new mattress, since ours is only about 5 years old and still good. I also wake up a lot less stiff in the morning, and almost no pain. I know these are supposed to be for pregnant women, but absolutely fabulous for people with back problems!"
b"It takes up a lot of room... even on a California King mattress but so worth it. I sleep like a baby on it. It can be molded and twisted to accommodate any sleeping or sitting position.  I wish I would have discovered this pillow when I had my mastectomy and I couldn't sleep in any position but on my back. It's kinda like a baby wedge to keep you from rolling over."
b'I was not sure about this pillow and I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure. It baffles me and for me maybe a miracle?!! I bought this pillow in hope that I might be able to stay in one position while sleeping. I have always been a problem sleeper (terrible) and actually injured my middle/upper back last August sitting up in the bed to flip over. I have no idea what it is like to sleep normal without constantly moving in my sleep, dreaming, wrestling something unknown. NOW is this new sleep I\xe2\x80\x99m experiencing normal? The pain in my back reoccurred several weeks ago. I was desperate to find something to keep me from moving about in my sleep. My back is feeling almost 100% and I wake up in the morning in the same position. It is so strange and unfamiliar for me to wake up not even being aware I was asleep or even in a bed. Sleep is now so empty and blank. I look so forward to going to bed to see if this is really real. Will I ever get used to this new normal? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know if this is normal because I have never experienced it before. I know this probably makes no sense and yes I am dumbfounded. Sleep for me now has never felt so strange lol but I feel great! I LOVE THIS PILLOW!'
b"I am 67 with previous back surgery and 2 dislocated shoulders and lupus which makes your body ache all the time. But the worst was trying to find a position for sleeping at night.This has changed my life. I was going to purchase a new bed but after looking at beds for weeks I just didn't see much difference. Plus the prices on queen mattresses was overwhelming. So I researched these pillows after getting a pop up ad on another brand. After checking these out I chose this one because of the length and it was reviewed to be very bendable like a nest so you can wrap it around you, or stretch the bottom out to raise your knees,so I can use it for many positions. They said they would have covers coming out soon. You can take the outer cover off and wash it but don't put in dryer just hang to dry. I use a bottom sheet to wrap around it until I get a cover. Also if it doesn't have enough bulk for you it has a zipper that opens to add more stuffing if you want. Definitely the best and at this price could do better."
b'I am not pregnant. I bought this to replace the four pillows that I usually use to support my back and hips. I need pillows on both sides because I am a side sleeper and need to switch sides a few times during the night. Verdict is...i love my new pillow! I still need to switch sides, but not as often. And because I no longer have to readjust all my pillows,  I barely wake up and easily go back to dreamland. Pillow keeps me nice and aligned. Perfect softness/firmness for my comfort.  I also love it for sitting up in the morning drinking coffee in bed and reading at night.'
b'Best purchase ever. I am 69 and obviously not pregnant. I bought it as an experiment to see if it could help me not roll onto my back because I snore and have sleep apnea when I do. It works really quite well \xe2\x80\x93 I use a snore monitoring app that shows that since using the pillow I have been snoring a lot less; I wake up feeling much more refreshed too. What I do is hug once side of the pillow and pull the other side close to my back. if I get too hot, I usually let go and then I will end up on my back again, so it is not a foolproof solution, but it is helping me delay getting a C-Pap machine. Highly recommended.'
b'This is a terrific product. I read all the reviews before I purchased one.  Yes, it certainly fills up the bed; yes, it makes things a bit warm--I bought one during the hot summer months in the south. And I can only wholeheartedly recommend it based on my experience!  No, I am not pregnant. I am a 70 year old woman with some aches and pains, and this pillow has revolutionized my sleeping experience and improved my morning aches better than any pill could! I would recommend one for anyone suffering from the same.  Only complaint -- I want a pillow case for the darned thing!'
b'Bought this for my wife, who is not pregnant. She wanted a large pillow to wrap around her at night, shield herself from my tossing and turning at night, and to "cuddle" with when I am all cuddled out..... Needless to say she loves this pillow and now refers to it as her "boyfriend".'
b"I love this pillow! It is much longer than many I've seen and doesn't force you to sleep with your legs in a 45* angle to enjoy the snuggle comfort of it. It seemed very small when I took it out of the package but over two days it bulked up in size. I was not a fan of the cover however. It felt very scratchy and was not comfortable to sleep on. I took off the cover and was fine sleeping on the pillow itself. I contacted customer service to find out if there was an alternative case to purchase. I received a reply within 30 minutes stating they are 3 weeks out from new covers and would be willing to send me a new cover when they become available.  Now that is customer service! I will update once the new cover is received."
b'It provides added comfort to my bed. I would like to find another color  pillow case for it. I am happy with this purchase. I have had a lengthy illness and spend lots of time in bed, so this pillow was well worth the money.'
b"Buy some extra pillow stuffing as many have recommended.  This is definitely money well spent, but in about two months many of the key support points need some extra stuffing to perk it right up.  Simply unzip, take some foam stuffing and put a few handfuls and rearrange it to suit your comfort needs.  This pillow will continue to provide me with full body comfort for some time to come.  Oh, and for the first time it'll fill out to full size in a day or two, but you can still use it right out of the box."
b"Purchased s a gift for my pregnant wife to help her with a more restful sleep. It definitely works more often than not and seems to have reduced her snoring some as well. Fluffy and relatively firm for MY liking. Putting a pillow case on this beast is like trying to put clothes on a 10' snake. Overall, she loved her surprise; she's only without it when the pillowcase is in the wash."
b"In preparation for my mastectomy surgery, I researched the items that would best help me convalesce.  This pillow is BY FAR the best thing I could have purchased.  Started using it a few weeks before surgery and  was able to get and stay comfortable in a variety of positions.  Now that I'm home from the hospital, I am more grateful than ever.  Even right after surgery I was able to rearrange the pillow by myself - it's pretty big! - but just sinking in to my nest and having the support and comfort I needed was vital.  I am able to get and stay comfortable all the time.  THANK YOU for making this product."
b'I order this pillow for my pregnant Daughter who was having a very hard time getting comfortable to sleep at night! She instantly fell in love with this pillow and texted me during a restroom trip during the night to tell me how amazing she was sleeping ! The only issue was her hubby said they needed to call it her "SNOR PILLOW "... LOL... it\'s an amazing product that arrived very quickly and allowed my VERY CRANKY PREGNANT  Daughter to finely get some much needed relaxing restful sleep!!... THANK YOU QUEEN ROSE we\'re all sleeping better now!!!...\xf0\x9f\x98\x82'

b'I recently purchased this pillow for use in supporting my belly that was swollen from surgery. I brought to the hospital with me and nurses loved the embroidered design, and how easy it was to spot the neon green amongst regular bedding. I loved how it was small enough to fit in a tote but big enough to support my poor stomach gently but firmly, and that it easily travels to cushion my surgical area from a seatbelt that may rub. My husband thought it was a no-big-deal gimmick until he tried it and found that it had eased his sciatica.  This is first time I have owned a pillow like this so I cannot compare to others like it. What I can say is that it\xe2\x80\x99s the same size and material and density as competitors that are nearly double the price.'
b'From a non-pregnant woman wanting a travel wedge this is great.  I use it under my back and also on my side under my knee.  Good support  even after being rolled up in the bag repeatedly.'
b'This is the same size and shape and density as the Hiccopop wedge pillow and half the price. I have both and used them with my pregnancy and for nursing. Great to keep in car for nursing in car or on airplane.'
b'Wife couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep without it when she was pregnant. Great buy \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc'
b'Cute pillow! I\xe2\x80\x99m using daily for better pregnancy sleep!'
b'Oh my goodness! Why had I never owned one of these before?!? This is my fourth pregnancy, 24 weeks, and slee is starting to become uncomfortable. I just received this today and am using it to rest on the couch and I feel so much relief from the weight! It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit smaller than I thought but it is actually the perfect size and I will be able to take it when we travel. I like that it has a zipper so I can take the cover off and wash it. Very happy!'
b'So comfortable thank u A+seller'
b'Great-  simple - soft'
b'Perfect and firm enough for my 9 months pregnant belly.'

b'I purchased one for my 86 year old mom, (she is not pregnant! Lol). She has a very bad back and issues getting comfortable sleep. This pillow has really made a difference! She loves it.I purchased another for an elderly lady as well, who spends most of her time in bed. I had it shipped to her and her daughter says she is in love with hers too! I will be back for more!'
b'This was such a great buy. My wife never uses any pillows or uses flat pillows. But once she was pregnant, this pillow was a life saver.She still uses it after birth to help her relax.The con is that this thing takes over the whole bed. Queen size bed is too small for it.  You need a king size bed.'
b"I finally splurged on a big u shaped pillow instead of using a c shaped pillow and loooooove it. I can roll over at night without rearranging the whole bed to come with me! The head part is the same stuffing as the rest so I usually need a thin pillow under it otherwise it's pretty flat for my head to rest on. But that's no big deal."
b'I recommend this pillow to all of my pregnant friends and friends with back prOblems. It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge pillow but it\xe2\x80\x99s great with relieving pain!'
b'Perfect, I got it for my fiance that is 5 months pregnant.. She loves it so far. Its very big and comes with its own cover. It takes up a lot of room but for her to be comfortable its worth it.'
b'A+++++. First nite using this awesome pillow i got my best nite of sleep. Actually slept 11hrs straight.  Luuuuv it! Highly recommended!!!'
b'I love the pillow ! I slept so comfortable and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a good night sleep in a while . It was a little weird just because I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to having so much comfort around me but it was easy to get used to also the material doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get warm it stays cool and that was my concern since I don\xe2\x80\x99t like my pillows to feel warm .'
b'fluffs up nicely after a bit.  Get a cover for it!  I use it to help me with back problems!!'
b'Very comfortable.'
b'I am recovering from a herniated disc and this pillow helps support my back while sleeping.'
b"It is PERFECT!!! I've seen a few complaints about it being flat. Mine took just a few seconds to fluff and it's HUGE. I'm laying in it as I type this and when I tell you at 6 months pregnant I've never been so excited to go to bed. Best buyyyy. \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a"
b"I'm 5ft tall and this pillow is perfect!  I can tuck it  between my legs and under my stomach for perfect support."
b'Best purchase in a long time'
b'Very comfy'
b'Super comfortable and helps GREATLY with my back and legs issues during y sciatica and fibromyalgia flare ups'
b'Pillow is huge and very comfy. Comes vacuum packed in a box. Has a pillow cover already on it. Love it!'
b'Love love love, made pregnancy sleep much better'

b'Awesome packaging, clean, easy to put the cover on. Happy it came with a pillowcase that you can wash. Comfortable!!!!!'
b'Thank you I love it'
b'I just love it....I sleep really comfortable. Its great.Its really big and take great part of the bed, but both my husband and I like to cuddle with it.'
b'This is lovely.. I bought this for my sister who had  trouble sleeping with her baby bump.. Now she sleeps like a baby with her baby.lol.. I would definitely reccommend this product.'
b'AMAZING FOR A FRIEND WHO IS POST HYSTERCOMY SURGERY. THIS PILLOW MADE RECOVERY CHANGE OVER NIGHT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.'
b"Even though the pillow case material isn't the softest, this pillow has been a life saver. It is so comfy and I cannot sleep without it now. My husband uses it when he takes naps and now he wants one too! \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82"
b"Bought this pillow for my wife who is currently 13 weeks.SHE LOVES IT!! She takes it from the couch to bed and back to the couch. She doesn't want to lay without it. She always complained about hip pain, rolling around, not being able to get comfortable, etc. NOT ANYMORE! Now she sleeps like a baby! (Until she actually HAS the baby lol)It stays soft and is not too stiff. It is right down the middle. If you need more support, or less, you might want to shop around. But, if you are looking for something right down the middle that can be soft, or scrunched up for more support, this is the one! (And without bunching in certain areas like a cheap pillow)I am speaking FOR her obviously, but if she was writing this she would probably concur. This is a GREAT gift for any expecting mother from day one. Don't wait to get her one of these! She will thank you!"

b'This is great if you are pregnant and want to lay on your belly while in bed!  I would still use it with something underneath you like couch cushions or a bed.  It supports you enough to help you sleep on your belly though!'
b'My wife was always a belly sleeper, in her 8th month of pregnancy she was losing her mind. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable and just wanted to sleep on her belly. Got this and had it inflated and ready for her when she got home. Within 10 minutes she was sound asleep. She loves it.'

b'This pillow is amazing. It is soft, silky, supportive, and pliable. In response to other reviews on the quality of the cover, it does pill, however it\'s washable and you can get replacement covers if this is an issue. It doesn\'t affect the functionality or softness at all, especially since I use this to sleep.I am a back sleeper, but am in my second trimester and need help sleeping on my side. This pillow is soft, but supportive, and has helped me sleep really well since it came two weeks ago. I originally purchased the same style pillow from Baby\'s R Us, but the cover on that ripped (10"!) during the first night because it had no give, and was poorly made. This pillow however is well made with a woven fabric (unlike the B-R-Us pillow) under the soft and pliable jacquard cover. I am also able to stack it into a comfortable back rest for sitting up in bed. I\'m 5\'3" and it does seem a little long in it\'s natural shape, but I\'m able to comfortably curl up in it, or bend it to cushion between my legs as needed.I didn\'t notice any smell when I unpacked my pillow (which I\'m normally sensitive to), and I tossed it in the dryer with some dryer balls for 10 minutes to fluff it up. Overall, I think it\'s worth every penny.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve only had this pillow for one day and one night & Im already in love. Although I bought this pillow for post surgery reasons & not maternal reasons. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hot & it\xe2\x80\x99s not cold, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s not your \xe2\x80\x9caverage pillow\xe2\x80\x9d. You can cuddle and snuggle this pillow, flip & flop all over & around it. You can even use it as a defense mechanism for the ultimate pillow fight (you WILL win!). I posted my picture of it on my queen size bed for a visual aid for anyone if it helps any. Also...no necks kinks! And being able to cuddle the top part of the c-opening allows me the throw a leg over the bottom part of the c-opening which is awesome for a side sleeper such as myself! Finally post hysterectomy I slept an entire night!Warning! This pillow may cause you to want to take a series of disco naps! Listen to the pillow & do as it says. Disco naps via day hours are awesome!I didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive any discounts or perks for writing this. I DID receive an epic pillow though!'
b'Wow! Omg! I love, love, love this pillow!!! It\xe2\x80\x99s soooooo soft! It also came super fast... like next day it was at my door. I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant by the way; I just love sleeping on this type of pillow. :)'
b"My wife's first night with this pillow was last night. She woke up refreshed and without back pain. It was the best night's sleep she has had in a couple of weeks. She is 6 months pregnant and this pillow will help get her the rest of the way. The fabric is soft, the filling is supportive. I highly recommend this pregnancy pillow. It arrived on time as promised."
b"I had a recent double masctomy with reconstruction. I was unable to get comfortable to sleep since I am a side sleeper. O ordered this pillow willing to try anything. It's amazing perfect amount of support to be on my side without and pain or pressure. Was able to sleep comfortable even with bilat JP drains."
b"Life saver!  Bought when I was 23 weeks pregnant and dealing with back pain and the inability to sleep at night.  I've only had this pillow a short while, so I can't speak to it's long term quality.  However, it is very very soft and comfortable and I have slept soundly since I got it.  I've also folded it in half a few times and used it for sitting up.  That works great too.  Highly recommended!"
b"This is the softest pillow I've owned.  My only complaint is it's very very big and takes up most of the room.  I'm not pregnant, nor will I become pregnant, but pillow helps me by having support on both sides of my body.  The bamboo is awesome."
b'Great shape for a body pillow. This pillow just fits perfectly, no matter who lays on it. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x9d and husband is 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\x9d and neither one of us have to do any major adjustments to use them. However, this is advertised as a \xe2\x80\x9cbamboo\xe2\x80\x9d pillow and it\xe2\x80\x99s only the slipcover that is made with bamboo. Disappointed because needed a full bamboo pillow because of allergies.'
b'UPDATE: the pillow does not last. While very comfortable, the pillow case pills terribly and has stringy threads on it that my foot got caught in last night. The pillow itself also has a tear in it now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for around 4 or so months, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sad it won\xe2\x80\x99t be lasting my entire pregnancy.I have always been a back sleeper, so being pregnant and not being able to lie flat on my back was hard for me! This pillow has helped me so much! I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping much better and am so grateful I bought it. Yay for good night sleeps!'
b'This pillow has helped me get some sleep as I progress through my pregnancy. Super soft, no chemical smell to the fabric or stuffing, nice quality cover. Only complaint is it kind of gets flat when I put it between my knees.'
b'Exactly as described and promptly shipped. I recommend ordering a cover. Even though it says it comes with one the cover is white and easily dirtied.'
b"I'm obsessed. This is so comfortable that once I'm out of bed, my dogs make their way into the middle of this. It's definitely helped me sleep better throughout my pregnacy."
b"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She's not pregnant, just has issues trying to sleep.  I like it more than she does and maybe I'll get to take it over... or buy another one for myself."
b'Excellent pillow! Gave my sister\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy pillow back because this one far surpasses it! Helps me get perfectly comfortable for good rest.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m only 4.5 months pregnant, and my belly is just now starting to show, but this has helped my hips and back dramatically.'
b'Great for the money. Recommend getting a cover to protect and keep its shape longer'
b'I bought this for my wife who is 4 months prego. She says this has completely changed how she sleeps. Win win for both of us :)'
b"4 months pregnant and I have not been able to sleep comfortably :( my boyfriend bought this pillow for me and it came the next day! Soooo comfortable! Last night was literally the best sleep I've had in the last month. I cant wait to get off work and get back home to my pillow lol."
b'Absolutely love it! It was my life saving item during last pregnancy months (or should I say sleep saving!). Had to fight my husband who loved it too\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3'
b'Absolutely recommend buying this pillow! I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 24 weeks pregnant. My partner bought this pillow for me and I have had some of the best nights sleeping with it. I even noticed I don\xe2\x80\x99t get up as much as I use to in the middle of the night.'

b'So great I purchased two more sets. They arrive very compact and in plastic. But this is the way most bedding arrives.I fluffed the pillows and sat them outside on the patio chairs. For the entire day- by nightfall they were fine. Fluffed againand used that evening. Incredible product - so I bought more. No poking of feathers. on any of the 3 sets (6 pillows) I purchased.I only wished I purchased these sooner. Kids have stolen each others and mine- absolute favorite pillows in the house.Comparable to the ones I had from the Company store but half the price.'
b'For the money this is a nice pillow for what I need. Currently having issues with my shoulders this is making is so that I can have soft support under my head and shoulders at the same time. Down the line I am sure I will invest a little more into a U pillow now that I have used one I love it. I am in Braces for my shoulders and this is helping me sleep for the time being. I have not slept since April.. How ever if pregnant I would move up to a more sturdy version..'
b'These pillows arrived in a compressed bag. Once I took them out, they were the perfect size for our king size pillow cases. These pillows have practically soft my neck problems. They form perfectly to my head and they were extremely affordable compared to department store pillows. It seems like their quality is equal to 100$ pillows.'
b'I love these pillows.  They do not flatten as easily as others I have owned.  I get a great nights sleep.'
b"This is the MOST COMFORTABLE pillow I've ever had in my entire life!! I am wheelchair bound due to a degenerative spine disease that causes bone fusion, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic severe pain. So I DEFINITELY know a comfortable pillow (with INCREDIBLE back and hip support) when I feel one!!"
b"I hadn't slept well for a few weeks as my pregnancy progressed. I was up and down and not able to fall back asleep. This pillow solved my issues! I'm now able to get comfortable quickly.  I call it my nest.  I toss and turn in my sleep and since this is a U shape, I'm able to easily move around and the pillow is there for me to hug again.  I'm also able to position it so I can sleep on my stomach (we'll see how long that lasts, but so far it works!)."
b'I finally bought a pillow for my Third pregnancy...wish I would have with my 1st and 2nd. It does take up some room, but so worth it. Beginning pregnancy, I used it upside down because the pillow seemed too high, but as soon as I was in my 3rd trimester, I used it the correct way and it was perfect.'
b'I slept so much better!!!! I finally slept good with this and got a peaceful sleep.  This is my third night using this.  I ordered one for my daughter now, since she keeps on wanting mine'
b"Great pillows. Bought them to keep in the camper but they are so comfortable I'm using these in the bedroom and putting our down pillows from the bedroom in the camper.  I'm ordering another set for our guest room.  Extremely comfortable!!"
b'Great quality for price, just need to let them rise and flufff a bit but exactly the firmness expected with a down pillow!'
b'I absolutely love this product! I was having the hardest time sleeping and now I sleep like a baby! It supports my bump and I have to have something between my knees because baby sits so low, and this helps so much! Love this pillow!'
b'These are great!  We purchased them to fill some Ethan Allen shams and they work perfectly.'
b'This helped TREMENDOUSLY when I was pregnant. The only pillow that gave me some type of relief.. I even continued to use it after I had my baby.I will say that it does seem to \xe2\x80\x9cfall apart\xe2\x80\x9d after taking the pillowcase on and off.. the outside layer of the actually pillow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem very thick..'
b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t even describe how my life is easier with this pillow. If you\xe2\x80\x99re like changing your side alot in sleeping,this is what you need.'
b'For the price it was exactly what I was expecting maybe a little more. A great value.'
b'This is a comfy pilllow designed for pregnancy\xe2\x80\x99s use. A u shape is perfect for three positions to lay on and the quality is good to support the whole body weight. I liked it also because the size is not super big, it does not take much space at all.'
b'Excellent'
b'Even better than I expected'
b'love them'
b'Pillows are super comfy with a nice thick covering.  No feathers sticking you while you sleep.'

b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve only had this pillow for one day and one night & Im already in love. Although I bought this pillow for post surgery reasons & not maternal reasons. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hot & it\xe2\x80\x99s not cold, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s not your \xe2\x80\x9caverage pillow\xe2\x80\x9d. You can cuddle and snuggle this pillow, flip & flop all over & around it. You can even use it as a defense mechanism for the ultimate pillow fight (you WILL win!). I posted my picture of it on my queen size bed for a visual aid for anyone if it helps any. Also...no necks kinks! And being able to cuddle the top part of the c-opening allows me the throw a leg over the bottom part of the c-opening which is awesome for a side sleeper such as myself! Finally post hysterectomy I slept an entire night!Warning! This pillow may cause you to want to take a series of disco naps! Listen to the pillow & do as it says. Disco naps via day hours are awesome!I didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive any discounts or perks for writing this. I DID receive an epic pillow though!'
b'Wow! Omg! I love, love, love this pillow!!! It\xe2\x80\x99s soooooo soft! It also came super fast... like next day it was at my door. I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant by the way; I just love sleeping on this type of pillow. :)'
b'This pillow has helped me get some sleep as I progress through my pregnancy. Super soft, no chemical smell to the fabric or stuffing, nice quality cover. Only complaint is it kind of gets flat when I put it between my knees.'
b"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She's not pregnant, just has issues trying to sleep.  I like it more than she does and maybe I'll get to take it over... or buy another one for myself."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m only 4.5 months pregnant, and my belly is just now starting to show, but this has helped my hips and back dramatically.'
b"4 months pregnant and I have not been able to sleep comfortably :( my boyfriend bought this pillow for me and it came the next day! Soooo comfortable! Last night was literally the best sleep I've had in the last month. I cant wait to get off work and get back home to my pillow lol."
b'Absolutely love it! It was my life saving item during last pregnancy months (or should I say sleep saving!). Had to fight my husband who loved it too\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa3'
b'Absolutely recommend buying this pillow! I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 24 weeks pregnant. My partner bought this pillow for me and I have had some of the best nights sleeping with it. I even noticed I don\xe2\x80\x99t get up as much as I use to in the middle of the night.'
b'My wife loves it! Really helps her sleep better at night.'
b'His pillow is amazing! I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x996 and it wraps perfectly around my pregnant body. It\xe2\x80\x99s soft and cozy and just the best thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve purchased since getting pregnant.'
b'Bought this for my daughter who was pregnant with twins! She absolutely loved it!!'
b'Obscenely soft, the perfect amount of fluff, and sturdy material (won\xe2\x80\x99t rip). Love the zip away cover it comes with!'
b"I didn't like that I had to cancel the first order and reorder it because my package got lost. However this is the comfiest pillow I've ever had!"
b'6 months pregnant and it is a dream. Had it for about 1 month, use it daily and it has kept its form.'
b'This is great and so soft! Slept better than I have in weeks! This pillow is just as good as those more expensive brands. Give it a try...'
b"Haven't been aware to sleep comfortably during this pregnancy until now! Completely changed the game. Highly recommend it!!"
b'Pillow fills super soft I love it so much haven\xe2\x80\x99t washed it yet but going to buy a pillow case for it'
b'So in love with this pillow. I have been sleeping so well. One of my favorite pregnancy purchases.'
b'I bought this last week and I love it. I can slee more comfortably now.'
b'Fantastic pillow my pregnant wife loves it. Where would I be able to find a pillow case for it?'

b"Bought this for my wife for her pregnancy.  She used to be able to sleep in seconds of closing her eyes.  With the baby, she's awake and uncomfortable.  Since she got this pillow, she can fall asleep instantly again.  She also has said her back and leg pain is better since sleeping with this.  She's been very happy.A happy wife = a happy husband.Also, I am a stay at home parent with the toddler and I have insomnia.  Doesn't make for a good mix.  I try to sleep when he naps (fewer and fewer).  If he actually took a 2 hour nap, I might get an hour if I was lucky.  I've been sneaking naps on this pillow while my wife is at work.  I've been falling asleep quickly and nap almost as long as my son.  I am giving serious consideration to buying another so I can have one to sleep on at night and maybe get more than 4hrs a night!The pillow also doesn't take up too much room which is nice.  The only difficulty is getting into the right position, but when you are there, it's bliss.  It comes with a zipper cover so you don't have to buy a pillow case.  We researched a lot of pillows and are very happy with deciding on this one."
b'Amazing!!  I am pregnant and do not know how I ever slept without this pillow!  I had the Leacho Snoogle for the past four months and had a lot of issues.  1. It is so hard to remove the outer shell to wash and once that is removed it takes 30 minutes to wrestle it back onto the pillow.  It was so frustrating that I would have to give to my Husband to handle.  2.  It start to loose it\xe2\x80\x99s shape quickly and where my legs would rest became flat regardless of fluffing.This C-Shaped Pillow by Blowout Bedding is perfect.  It has a zipper liner for easy removal and to place back on!  Also it is more firm and the inner liner seems to be tighter and thus the pillow will stay true to form.  I am a person who typically moves a lot and now that I am 22 weeks pregnant moving is getting harder to do at night, but with the support this pillow offers I didn\xe2\x80\x99t move for 6 hours and got the most rest I have in the past month!!'
b"Got this at 28 weeks and has been a lifesaver the last few weeks. I kept waking up in the middle of the night when I would roll onto my back and get woozy. This is great for laying on either side and can stay comfortable. I can even lay slightly on my back/stomach with the right angling of the pillow.We will see how this goes in another month or so (but at that point, I don't know how comfortable I can expect to be in general). I would highly recommend if you have been having trouble getting comfortable or waking up a lot at night."
b"Has become ESSENTIAL during my 3rd trimester. I started with this pillow in my 1st and it was a bit of a pain to get in and out of at night. Now - I wouldn't be able to live without it! The back support has become increasingly important now that I can truly only lay on my side. I double up with an extra pillow on my back sometimes and it's immediate relief. I can't imagine NOT having this through my pregnancy. Best purchase I have made!"
b'My wife loves it.  It\'s been great giving her support by keeping her hips aligned and giving her that "nesting" feeling.  No chemical smells at all.  Still fluffy after 2.5 months.  I hate it because it gets in the way of cuddling :)  From what I\'ve heard you either love or hate pregnancy pillows in general.'
b'I bought for my wife, who at the time of the purchasing was about three months pregnant. She liked it immediately, and still sleeps in it very happily. One possible shortcoming with this pillow is that it is hard to find a pillow-case for it (unless one sows it on his/her own). But my wife has found a way around it, and the absence of the case has not diminished its overall value.I am happy I bought it.'
b"This pillow helped me actually get comfortable while sleeping for the first time during my pregnancy. By itself, it was a little scratchy on my skin, so I ordered the Zippered Pillowcase Cover. That thing has the texture of a soft teddy bear. As soon as I get up in the morning, my husband always cuddles with the pillow till he gets up. This thing is amazing. If you're pregnant, get it!!"
b"Highly recommend buying this even if your wife isn't pregnant. My wife  loves this pillow and I don't think she will ever give it up. I purchased early in her pregnancy and she used it the whole time. Made for sleeping very comfortable.  It has a removable cover that is machine washable.  This is a great product!"
b"This pillow is a lifesaver for me. As soon as I received it, I followed the instructions to a T and the pillow expanded to this extremely fluffy, yet supportive pillow. When I laid down for the night, I literally giggled with delight b/c I felt so comfy and supported.Major Positives:(1) I am a back sleeper. For some reason, in your second and third trimester you aren't supposed to lay flat on your back. I would ALWAYS end up on my back. This pillow does not allow me to roll onto my back at all. And when I do, I am at an angle, which my doctor says is totally appropriate and say.(2) I had been struggling with lower back pain and this eases the pain tremendously.(3) The pillow is cushy enough that my husband and still snuggle next to me and I don't feel separated from him.(4) It is supporting my growing belly.The only negative I can come up with is this:You remain on whatever side you start on-you cannot turn over and maneuver this pillow if you have a double bed. To me, this is more of a neutral than a negative, because doctors encourage you to sleep on your left side anyway.I saw a review or two that said the pillow smelled. That was not my experience at all. The pillow is perfect in my opinion. A must buy!"
b"Yay! Great price for a fantastic pillow! I had one of these during my pregnancies, but thought I'd never need it again so I got rid of it! Now that I'm approaching 40 I've had horrible back pain... I toss and turn and any pillow that I tried to put between my knees would get lost in the middle of the night with my restlessness! Now I'm getting great sleep, not moving as much and my back pain has gotten so much better!"
b"I cannot even begin to tell you how much better I've been sleeping since I started using this pillow. It's actually a gift from the heavens. I started using it around 8 weeks pregnant and I love it so much. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. 11/10 would recommend to a friend."
b"This is the one of the best products I have invested my money in. This pillow is perfect. I sleep so good with it and my back doesn't hurt anymore because my spine is now aligned straight with the pillow in between my knees. You can always fluff the pillow back to shape if it starts to get a little flat and then it's just like new. The pillow case is really soft and plush. I honestly sleep like a baby. Sorry for babbling but I would recommend to everyone."
b'The pillow is large and plush. It came in a small box and was very compressed, which took a fair amount of time to fluff back to its regular form. Its great for positioning though, and it is easily  a good investment.'
b"My wife loves this pillow. She began to suffer from severe back pain at the beginning of her second trimester. This pillow helped a lot. The cushion is firm enough for support but comfortable. We've had it for a couple months now and she hasn't noticed any indentations. It is a little big for her (she's 5') but it still works well. The cover unzips so it's easy to keep clean."
b"Sleeping so much more comfortably since buying this pillow. Took a few days to get used to it, but overall very happy with this purchase. Great support. Decent size. Priced better than the name brand pregnancy pillows. Love the fleece cover. Not sure how it will wash up, but I'd highly recommend this pillow for expectant mamas"
b"I've been using this since I was 20 weeks, and I LOVE it.  This is big, so it takes up a lot of space in my bed, but it is soft, compfy, and really helps with my back pain.  I always sleep on my back, so this pillow helps me to sleep on my left side.  The best thing about this pillow is that you can take the cover off and wash them!! :)"
b"My daughter has been using this throughout her pregnancy. She says it is the most comfortable thing she has ever slept with. Offers her support for knees and belly. When you aren't sleeping with it and after the baby is born, it can be folded in half to use as something to help the baby sit up."
b'My wife loved this when she was pregnant, she slept better and was more comfortable.'
b'I got this for my pregnant daughter-in-law. She said it helps by supporting her back while sleeping.'
b"Very comfortable and easy to position for what fits your body best. Because it's flexible it doesn't take up too much space either so my husband is happy too."

b'Absolutely Amazing!This review is coming from a woman with multiple joint problems including subluxing neck, shoulders, hips and spine. I have purchased every known neck and support pillow, including body pillows, known to man, and have never found one that works all by itself. After buying an adjustable bed I still had 8 pillows on my side...and carried these from room to room to sew, read or watch TV...then back to bed they came. I took a chance and bought the Meiz U Shaped Pillow after reading the reviews and comparing it to similar pillows...and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I did!  Being a side sleeper and using this pillow, there is no readjusting pillows whenever I turn over. The long arms bend to provide arm, shoulder and knee support, and I no longer need a head pillow. The 8 pillows I used to use?...in the closet. The long arms and back provide support in my favorite chair to elevate my books or sewing. The side arms support arms and elbows; the top of the U prevents my back from resting on an uncomfortable surface. The microfiber cover is soft; the stuffing is also soft yet supports very gently. It\xe2\x80\x99s big...but if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide the support for your limbs from head to toe. A big plus for me was the washable cover came with the pillow; with most other pillows the covers were $20+ extra. I\xe2\x80\x99m not being paid to say these things...I\xe2\x80\x99m just so happy I finally found what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching for - for decades!'
b"I'm a man and I bought this to use during my second round of chemotherapy. During my last round I was prone to muscle fatigue and joint pain which made a good night's sleep a challenge. One of the best positions was lying on my side, but 'leaning' back slightly to alleviate pressure on my hip joint. Trying to place regular pillows was difficult as one would always slip or compress more than the others. Knowing this in advance I looked for alternatives and stumbled across this pillow. This pillow gives me support from my head and neck to my calves that is consistent.It also helps to be able to place on leg on the side like the lady in the picture is doing. I know that looks like an awkward pose for joint pain, but it works for me. My only suggestion would be to offer this with a cover that is 100% cotton. The plushy microfiber material doesn't breath well and another of my my chemo side effects is an issue regulating my body temperature consistently. My dog likes it, too. I've had to send her to her own pillow a few times. She seems okay with that option."
b"This is the BEST investment I've ever made for my sleep! I know this is a maternity pillow, but I am not pregnant. I just got tired of trying to place pillows between my knees, under my neck & head, etc. I'd bought a regular body pillow but it wasn't doing the trick. This pillow saved the day...and my sleep! I've slept more soundly with this pillow than I have in ages!"
b"I got this for my expecting wife because she is having problem sleeping at night. The first night sleeping with it, she was instantly in love with it. Her pains and discomforts is gone and now she wouldn't sleep without it. She is 5'2 and it fits her perfectly."
b"It is so great for pregnancy and worth every penny.  It is sooooooo soft too.  The head support was a little too thick for my neck, but I ended up flipping it, so that the head part is by my feet now and I'm just using my regular pillow.  But I am finicky about my pillows for my neck.I normally do not sleep on my side, so this helped me a lot to adapt to it.  It is great if you toss and turn too because it is not hard to readjust compared to the one sided pillows or just normal pillows."
b"I'm a little over 6 weeks, going on 7, and ever since I found out i was pregnant a few weeks ago, my lower back has been killing me. It was a big symptom i would have prior to getting my period, but this has been constant. I'm a chronic back and stomach sleeper & although that's ok to do for right now, my back just wasn't having it anymore. Sleeping on my side was really difficult to get used to and my back never seemed to get the support i needed now matter how many cushions i used. I got this in yesterday, and WOW! This is a life changer. I zoned out so fast once I got situated and it's perfectly firm. Don't need any extra pillows for my head. This is all you need. I was scared about the reviews of the size, but I'm happy to report that this is perfectly situated on my side of the bed & doesn't disturb my husband and we have a queen. Don't hesitate! Invest in your sleep before your bundle of joy arrives!"
b"This is a review from someone who is NOT pregnant, & also not paid to write this review..  My dog wasn't paid either!This pillow is mainly the only reason I have slept after my car accident.. I had a slipped disc, bulging disc, misaligned spine and neck. Slightly dislocated hip and I was tossing and turning for hours, unable to get comfortable in any position. No matter how many pillows were on my bed (at least 5) I could not find a position that would allow me to stay still for more than 5 minutes. I was a walking zombie 3 days after my accident and then I was doing reviews on pregnancy pillows AND I AM SO GLAD I DID.This pillow is so comfortable, very durable.. I've tossed this in and out of my car and house for when i'm sleeping at my boyfriends, etc. and it has kept its shape and is still as comfortable as the first day I got it!The packaging was awesome and it took it's shape within minutes. I don't even think that I will ever go back to my original $160 pillow! Even after I am fully recovered. THAT'S how great this pillow is.If you're on the fence, just buy the pillow. You won't regret it!Side note: You should make one half the size for dogs.. Mine steals my pillow the second he is in the bed alone!"
b'Love the pillow, hate the velvet (fuzzy) cover. Yes it\xe2\x80\x99s soft, but it makes me sweat! Thankfully I found a replacement cover that fits!-Ang Qi Stretch Jersey Pregnancy Pillowcase - Total Body/Maternity Pillow Replacement Cover - U Shaped Pillowcase - Fit 55" x 31" Pillows - Gray-I found it by using the pillow\xe2\x80\x99s measurements. The pillow gives great support. I have a queen size bed, and it takes up basically my side of the bed.'
b"Love it! I'm not pregnant, but always use a ton of pillows so my husband got this for me and it's perfect!"
b"I was afraid this would be a flat, scratchy, pillow that didn't provide much support but as my pregnancy has been chasing a lot of discomfort at night and I keep ending up sleeping on my back which isn't good for baby. This pillow is awesome and I was completely blown away!!It fluffed up into a thick, fluffy pillow that became pretty firm after a few minutes, in a good way, and the pillow case is actually very soft and delicate.It's a huge pillow...like bigger than me and takes up half our queen sized bed (poor husband) but I have slept wonderfully with my growing belly. The curves in the shape allow it to support my back, belly, and hips all while providing a supportive pillow for my neck. I don't use any other pillows now and don't find myself waking up on my back anymore as the full body support keeps me from rolling too much.Definitely worth the price!!"
b'One of the most comfortable pillows I have.  I have tried numerous pillows to include "My Pillow" and this is the first pillow that I didn\'t wake up the next morning with soreness in my back and neck.  If you are a tall person (more than 5\'8") I would recommend the longer one.  While it did lose some of the firmness after several nights....I plan to just add more stuffing to fluff it back up.'
b'Ever since I bought this body pillow about 6 months ago, it is a joy to jump in bed at night or for a nap.  Even when I make a trip out of town and I drive, the pillow goes with me. I wish I could take it with me when I fly and just say it is a big neck pillow.  I think I could sleep on the floor and still be comfortable with this pillow.  I got it with the plush velour gray cover.  The cover is very soft to touch to add even more comfort.  I called the company to let them know I wanted to buy a second gray velour cover to use while I wash the first one and they gave me a code to get a discount on the second cover.  I cannot say how much I love this pillow because it puts me in heaven when it cradles me.  I have an old injury in my right hip that used to wake me up at night with pain.  This pillow cushions every part of my body so I never wake up at night with pain any longer.  When I sit up to read or watch TV or videos on my Kindle Fire, I prop the body pillow up against a TV pillow at the head of my bed and the comfort is exhilarating.  I cannot say how much I love this pillow and for the price, it cannot be beaten!'
b"Best pillow ever! I'm not pregnant, but my husband goes out of town a lot for work. I have a hard time sleeping with such an empty bed that I always put a body pillow right behind me to help me sleep. This pillow is so comfortable that now I can rest a little easier while he's gone. The pillow cover is very soft and the pillow was nicely filled (no empty sections). I know it'll be great next time I'm pregnant. It's a little high for my neck for sleeping, but I just flip it around and put the bottom up by my face so I can sleep with my regular pillow."
b'I\'m 5\'3", slim/petite build and almost 5 months pregnant. This pillow is a life saver! I wasn\'t sleeping through the night until I got this pillow to support my legs, back and belly. Its soft, plush, and perfectly proportioned to the body. I\'ve used it with my pillow and without at the headrest and both are comfortable. Since I can only sleep on my side now this has been such a relief - I can wrap my body around this pillow and get the support both me and the baby need to sleep comfortably.Even my husband has considered swiping this from me a few times :)Note: It comes with a very plush fleece-like pillow case. It doesn\'t make me too hot but I can imagine some people would want a diff type of pillow case.'
b'Okay so I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even a female. I have to sleep with something between my legs, usually a pillow or balled up blankets. I have really bad knee pain and hip discomfort the next day if I don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep that way. This pillow was perfect and super comfy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can ever do without it now. Wifey was super jealous the next morning because I hugged the pillow more than I hugged her. We both share the pillow now so she can feel loved too. Very versatile pillow.'
b'This is my fourth pregnancy I wish I found this pillow five years ago. It gives awesome support for your legs, belly, and back. Finally getting some rest! Its very soft and not too thick because I found with previous pregnancy pillows I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up with aches in my neck. I would definitely even use this even after pregnancy it\xe2\x80\x99s such a comfortable pillow that gives a ton of body support!'
b"This pillow is amazing!!!!!! I am a big stomach sleeper & it causes so much pain to my back. Especially when I first wake up. I do my workouts in the morning & with sleeping on my stomach all night, it causes a tweak in my back, so it takes about 10-15 mins to really be able to start going hard in my workout & I'm still careful. I did not buy this pillow because I am pregnant in anyway, I bought it to keep me from flipping onto my stomach at night. It works like charm! The velvet cover is soooo soft & amazing & doesn't make me hot at night either. If you need to stop sleeping on your stomach, GET THIS PILLOW. Most comfortable sleep ever."
b'I just received this yesterday so I used it for the first time last night.I am absolutely amazed! I have had a weird leg pain off and on for at least 5 years, starts at the hip and goes down to my knee. It has something to do with lateral movement. When I lay down I notice it a lot more since I sleep on my side. I try to use a pillow under my knee but it doesnt stay put so it is a constant struggle. The comfort that this "u" shaped pillow provides is unbelievable! I slept so well last night and sitting up to watch tv or work on the computer is much more comfy too. Everyone should use one of these because I think you would all benefit from it. Very pleased with my purchase! Might make these a Christmas present for family members next Christmas!'
b"This pillow is perfect for anyone looking for more comfort in bed. It's lightweight and so super soft that I don't want to leave it!"
b'Since unwrapping this pillow today, I can honestly say this is the most comfortable I have been in a while! I\xe2\x80\x99m very early in my pregnancy, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a side sleeper, and my hips have been very sore lately. Top it off with the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bad cold, this pillow is a God-send for me right now! Super lightweight and very soft! Only concern I have is that the cover seems a little flimsy. Easy enough fix to hand-stitch if the zipper comes loose. So worth the money to be comfortable!!'

b'This was loaned to me due to the fact I have a shattered spine that is essentially discintegrated. I need a lot of support while sleeping to get thru the night. I have never quite had what I would call pain free rest. Until this pillow......wow is an understatement. I can wrap this thing around and thru in a way it fully supports me. That moment of realization you feel no pressure...is when you fall asleep and get rested. I will buy again.'
b"Bought it at the end of my first trimester, and begrudgingly so. I was skeptical of spending this much money on a pillow. I WAS WRONG. This pillow is so fantastic that I have given her a name. I regret nothing. The length is great (I'm 5'9 so I'm tall) and the cover is SO SOFT. Love that is can be removed and washed really easily to, but I haven't actually washed it yet so I can't really say how it washes up. I love her and cannot imagine sleeping through my pregnancy without her."
b"I cant even explain how much I love this pillow. I bought 4 pregnancy pillows before I decided on this one. I am 3 months pregnant and even if I wasn't, I would still love this pillow. It has the perfect amount of firmness, and is just sooo comfortable! I feel like I am sleeping much better with this pillow. I bought another one to try but am not even going to bother with it, since I have been so comfortable with this one. I do with it was a little longer, but that is just because I am tall and its my preference, but honestly..it is fine how it is and works great. Love my new pillow!"
b"This is the best sleep I've had in a very long time! This pillow is a life saver. I ordered the extra long pillow with the removable cover. I got exactly that and it's exceeded my expectations. I'm not pregnant....long past that phase in my life. However, I do sleep on my side for the most part and usually have my head slightly elevated. I have gone from waking up multiple times in the night to readjust pillows that have slipped out of place to sleeping all the way through the night without having to make adjustments. The pillow is slightly firmer than what I was used to but it offers great support and keeps me from rolling onto my back and off the pillows. Love it!"
b'The best pregnancy pillow ever! This is the second pillow I got from Ang Qi. My husband after using my 55 inch one loved it so much I ordered him a longer one! I love the jersey cover because it is so easy to take off and put back on. My sister-in-law got a different pillow when she got pregnant and it was a pain to wash the cover because it was so difficult to take off and put back on. The jersey cover it came with is stretchy so it eliminates that problem completely. The cover is also very soft and keeps me cool during the hot summer nights! I absolutely love this pillow and would recommend it to anyone (not just pregnant women) who is in need of a body pillow!  (Even our dog loves the pillow!!)'
b"I'm 5'9'' and this pillow has changed my entire course of sleep, in a good way!! Like most, I wish I would've ordered this pillow when my pump started to show. I cannot sleep without this pillow! I have tried and it's hell! Lol! I am now 33 1/2 weeks pregnant and it's the only thing that helps me get through the night! When we travel to my mom's my boyfriend already knows that we are not to leave the house without that pillow or it will be a VERY long unpleasant weekend. Lol! I recommend this pillow to all pregnant and non pregnant women and folks alike!"
b'Do not look any further! This pillow is fantastic, the cover is so soft and its the perfect amount of support. I researched a ton of these and finally decided on this. I am 21 weeks pregnant but I have been having a hard time sleeping without hip pain for a few weeks. This was 100% solved by this pillow. I look forward to going home and curling up inside of it. Even my husband is jealous!'
b'Love love love it. Should have bought one of these 15 years ago'
b'So happy with my purchase! I\xe2\x80\x99m 6 months pregnant and have been using this body pillow for about a month and a half now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sleeping much better at night. This is my second pregnancy. I used the C shaped body pillow for my first pregnancy, and I think this pillow is much more comfortable. I ordered the gray velvet pillow cover and have no regrets! It\xe2\x80\x99s so soft, great pillow! It\xe2\x80\x99s also narrower than other similar pillows that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, which gives my husband more room on his side in our queen size bed.'
b'This pillow is a (preggo) lifesaver!! At 22 weeks pregnant, the aches and pains started setting in - waking me up and causing me to limp out of bed in the morning. I tried pillows on every angle...in front, back, between the legs, etc., without relief. After two weeks of misery, I ordered this pillow, and have slept soundly and painfree ever since!Length is also a bonus! I am 6\xe2\x80\x991\xe2\x80\x9d and while I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a surplus of length in this pillow, I am able to put the ends between my knees. The name brand pillow that I tried in store was not long enough for this. I do find that I still need 1 extra pillows for the legs to feel well enough supported.I am slightly worried about how long the stuffing will hold up, but for now I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a cloud.'
b'This pillow has taken away all of my nighttime hip pain! I am sleeping SO much better with this pillow. The snoogle was not fluffy enough to provide support and because its shaped like a "C", every time I turned, Id have to turn it with me, pain. This pillow being shaped like a U, just stays in place as I move around and it is much more full, so it seems to provide better support and also keep me from rolling totally flat on my back. Love.'
b'This pillow is so great! 2nd pregnancy and I have given up the stacked pillow fort of the old days. It is very cozy and comfortable- just wish it was longer because it does not go all the way to my feet. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and ordered the 60\xe2\x80\x9d pillow. Sleeping much more and more comfortably now that I have this support for back and belly. Wish the pillow case for this pillow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so expensive, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I ended up getting it too.'
b"Best pillow ever. I've never slept better"
b"I bought this pillow, not because I was pregnant, but because I have frozen shoulder.  No matter which way I turned, I would need to move the pillows surrounding me to support the shoulder.  Pillows were dropping all over the place and I had trouble sleeping for more than a couple of hours at a time.  I bought this pillow and have drastically reduced the number of pillows I need at night and can now regularly sleep through the night, It also replaces the pillow I had to support my knees while sleeping.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is currently suffering from the same problem. We are both 5'11' and the larger size pillow option was wonderful since most of these types of pillows only support shorter people."
b'For my wife this was a lifesaver. She had a regular body pillow that while very comfortable pre pregnancy didn\xe2\x80\x99t cut the mustard during. She said the curve that goes around your neck was the difference. It aligned her body well.'
b'I dont know what I did without this pillow before pregnancy. I will use this after pregnancy too. My Hubby likes it too! Good quality and its great that you can wash the cover. Worth the price. Its great on the bed for sleeping and great on the couch to just be comfortable.'
b"This pillow is amazing. It supports my back and my belly. My hips and my back don't hurt as bad when I wake up in the morning.  I wish I would have bought this pillow sooner.  It's really nice. I'd definitely recommend it."
b"I love it! It gives me back support and belly support as well as being able to have my legs separated and that is a big plus when you have 7 m bump! It's also awesome to help you get a bit higher to avoid reflux."
b"I'm 5.5 months along, and this has improved my side sleeping by leaps and bounds! It takes so much stress and tension off your lower back. My maternity massage therapist recommended using a body pillow for that. This one is especially good because it will support you as you turn from side to side throughout the night!"
b'I bought this for my daughter as she is pregnant with twins. It is very soft and supportive. Her husband doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind borrowing it either!!'

b"Hello, I'm back with this Leachco upgrade.  I originally had what I am considering the first edition\xc2\xa0Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory\xc2\xa0of this Back 'N Belly pillow, due to unfortunate circumstances of moving in with a guy, only having a queen bed, blah blah, relationship, my original pillow ended up getting thrown out.  I can't believe I did that either.  I'm terrible.  Luckily I'm single again and have my queen bed all to myself, and with the size of this pillow, you need it.First, it arrived in a the biggest box I've ever seen Amazon ship to me.  There was no shrink wrapping or anything for this pillow, so it was its full massive size when it arrived.  It came with a large printout of the pillow positions, which was pretty cool.  Also, it talks about the difference of zipper up/zipper down, which zipper up provides more support in the middle U part of the pillow, zipper down is more for sleeping.Second, the pillowcase is much softer than the other Leachco pillow, and SO MUCH EASIER to remove. An incredible difference!!  I took off the cover and washed it on cold, then tumble dried low, as the instructions said.  I timed myself putting it back on, 3 minutes.  That time could have something to do with a cat that likes to swipe at my laundry, but it is so much easier to take on/off.The pillow construction itself is a lot better.  So, one of the bigger problems with the other model was the seam.  It was 2D construction, in that it was 2 seams total, one on the outside, one on the inside.  This pillow is like 3D construction and has multiple seams (like V Seams, see photo) to support the curvature of the pillow, moving the pillow how you want is super easy, and also, no seam that digs into your neck or shoulder!  The stuffing of the pillow is full and soft, it reminds me of the Beautyrest Black Label or Black Diamond pillows from Costco, just a really soft and fluffy marshmallow nest.I still don't have kids, but I still have hip and lower back pain, and this pillow is helping me already.  My cat loves to sleep on the sides of it with me as well.  If you are thinking about a Leachco, I would highly recommend spending the additional dollars to get this one.  The seam issue alone is worth the upgrade.  It takes a couple nights to get used to sleeping with Phillow again, but now that we are back together, nothing can tear us apart.  For couples, you can have it in an L shape if you need to, it's flexible!"
b'I love my pillow! I tried the snoogle first per a friend suggestion and found the inner seam cutting into my neck. As I continued to search I found a lot of The pillows reviews complained of the seam... The bliss is made without the inner seam for Ultimate comfort. Since getting the pillow I have had a much better night sleep. And little back pain. I highly recommend the Bliss over any of the others.'
b"Trying to decide if you need to get this for your pregnant wife/GF/partner/whatever? HELL YES! This has been the best purchase I have made so far during my wife's pregnancy (and I've made a few). I surprised her with this monster of a pillow at the end of her 2nd trimester and I'm quite sure I could ignore her for the rest of this pregnancy and she would still love me. I will warn you, unless you have a king sized bed you are about to lose the majority of your already diminishing sleep space. She sleeps like a rock now and her hip pain is pretty much gone. If this pillow was a man she would leave me for it. I'm cool with it. It makes her completely happy and she sleeps much better which means that I am happy and I sleep better too."
b"This pillow allows you to sleep in multiple positions comfortably. I'm not pregnant but recently had a mommy makeover and this made having to sleep on my back bearable. It is quite large, so if you have anything smaller than a king size bed or sleeping with a partner..this might not work for you. Great pillow though!"
b"Not pregnant and never had a baby before, but I use this thing nightly to help with back and shoulder pain.  I now can't sleep without it.  I even packed this sucker in a Space Bag to take it on a trip overseas.  Worked like a charm.  This is my wubby!"
b'Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be sleeping in the same bed as my partner anytime soon because between me and the pillow there\xe2\x80\x99s no extra room! However, this pillow is great and the sateen cover makes for extra comfort if you\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping on your side. Phenomenal for my back!'
b'The Back and Belly Bliss was a gift to for my daughter in law. She told me it was the best gift she received. Great for back and tummy support. She has been sleeping with it since Jan.Our granddaughter will be born in July. A lot of restful nights.'
b'Very good quality/ I was worried about it if its gonna be firm enough, its perfect for me. I am 5 feet 10 so i got the 65" one. love this!!!'
b'Helped with back pain immediately. You can feel the back ache go away as soon as you tuck it under your back.  The only down side is everyone loves it so I have to keep stealing corners of it back from our Labrador and my husband all night long.'
b'Has really helped stay on my side my entire pregnancy, it is huge, but it is worth it.'
b'Love it you can use it even after giving birth \xf0\x9f\x99\x82'
b'Pillow is huge.  Takes up more then half the queen size bed but my wife is happy'
b'Had one of these during pregnancy and it was amazing! Unfortunately got rid of it after and purchased for comfort post tummy tuck. The first one I had was super long like down to my feet. I do prefer that over the shorter one but didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it as an option anymore.'
b"As other reviews mentiomed, this thing is huge but I love it. I have shoulder pain so sleeping on my side is really difficult but you have to at a certain point in pregnancy. This thing worked well and for once I didn't wake up uncomfortable 10 times during the night. It helps to wrap the sheets around it and put the back side between your legs, then it doesn't splay as wide. My husband was okay with it but it does take up a pretty large portion of our queen bed. He laughed at me in my nest but hey, at least I got some good sleep finally!"

b"Love this pillow. It really helps me to stay asleep on my side. The pillow case is easy to remove and replace and 100% cotton. This pillow is huge! I sleep with it on top of my bedding as it would be difficult to get it under the bed covers, but I don't mind since I am getting a much improved sleep quality. I wake up with little to no morning pain now. I have fibromyalgia and read on a fibro blog about this pillow. I am very happy to have found it on Amazon!"
b'Excellent! Daughter-in-law is pregnant and is having complications with twins. This pillow is what she wanted and it is the best. She is bed rest and pillow does everything she needs to be comfortable and supports her.'
b"I have terrible and I mean terrible arthritis.  I bought a new bed and it still wasn't comfortable until I bought this body pillow, now I am in heaven..Very well made, easy to wash the outer cover, however, I suggest hang to dry don't use the dryer.  This product is very well made and now I am pain free at night."
b'I recently had a rotator cuff repair surgery. In talking with others and discussing my need to be in control of my pillow and the need for something large and flexible, my niece mentioned this pillow she used during her pregnancy.  It was the perfect solution for sleep with my situation.  Allowing it to prop over my other pillows and to provide that gully I need on both sides for support especially the side where surgery was performed.  My Sanggol was the perfect solution.  I would highly recommend it.'
b'Love it! Helped me sleep on my side especially with my neck and shoulders!  I love that it\'s big (and has many uses as described on the page) and not too bulky or too high, it\'s just right (fyi, I\'m 5\'4")!  Pillow cover is soft.'
b'Just arrived today I love it its so comfortable & I slept on it right awaySo excellent packaged perfectly thank u!'
b"Received my body pillow a few weeks ago and love, love love it.  Took me a few nights to experiment with different positions so I wouldn't wake up with a hip or back ache but once I did it was heaven.  Feels like your being cradled in a cloud and makes me feel very protected.  I'm not pregnant but I am very thin so the softness of the pillow protects my joints from pressure while I sleep and supports my back and hips when I turn on my side. I used to put regular pillows under my knees but they would always fall off the bed and never felt comfortable like the Sanggol pillow. Once you sleep with this pillow you'll never want to be without it."
b'I love this pillow. Its so comfy and it has truly helped my lower back. i love the fact that i can have one  end  between my legs to elevate and align my spine and the other end to support my lower back.'
b"I love this pillow. My back pain and restless legs stop when I use it. The filling does move but a shake and it's comfortable again. It also keeps me warm."
b"I bought this body pillow because I had knee replacement surgery.  I have a very hard time sleeping at night because I can't get comfortable.  This pillow was recommended by a fellow replacement patient.  It really makes a difference."
b'Great shape price fast delivery I made a custom pillow case for it and I was the envy of everyone at the baby shower'
b'This pillow stopped my pregnant wife from tossing and turning all night and waking up bitching about not being able to get comfortable!!!!'
b'She loves it.'
b"Wife stated its the best sleep she's had in 12 weeks.. Very comfortable and versatile. Great buy for the fellas to surprise their baby mama with!"
b'great'
b"This is my second pregnancy and I'm so glad I invested into this upgraded maternity pillow. It truly hugs your body as you flip throughout the night. I love this pillow and look forward to getting in bed at night!"
b"I bought the pillow for my daughter who is pregnant and she absolutely love it. She is very satisfied. It's great support for her stomach and back. Delivery was very fast. She got it earlier than expected."
b'Great'
b'It fits my body perfectly. Very comfortable.'
b'Just received this yesterday and last night got the best night\'s sleep in ages. I have arthritis in my knees and hips, and I need to sleep on my back, which isn\'t natural for me. With this body pillow, I avoided rolling over in my sleep, which means I also avoided waking up with pain in my knees and hips. I picked this particular item over similar body pillows, because I\'m tall (5\' 10"). It was long enough to tuck both "loose ends" under my knees while resting my head in the curve of the U.'

b'If you find this review helpful - please click HELPFUL :)This pillow has made my pregnancy experience so much better! I wish I had not hemmed and hawed over this pillow vs the big baby store versions. This pillow is far superior! I have been using it now nightly for several months and this holding up great! If you are considering this purchase, just go for it. I suffered for about a month of restless pregnancy sleep before ordering and I wish I had ordered the day I felt sore. Great product for a great price and can\xe2\x80\x99t beat the quick shipping (also - it did not have a smell that some packaged items develop, which I was incredibly thankful for). Photo is after months of use and it\xe2\x80\x99s holding up super nicely!'
b"Oh my!  I'm 64 and not gonna be pregnant anytime soon. But my rotator cuff issues make it impossible to sleep comfortably on my side and I was having difficulty getting comfortable on my back until this pillow arrived. Really has reduced tossing and turning so my sleep is better."
b'Without this pillow, my lower back is screaming in the mornings and I can barely walk, even with a sleep number bed.  Has made a night and day difference. I didn\'t realize how much it helped until I stopped using it for a few weeks. I had to get one for my 4 yr old son because he kept stealing it!  We love sleeping in our "pods."'
b"O.m.g. why didn't I get this pillow sooner?? I didn't believe all the hype about a pregnancy pillow, but my husband bought it for christmas. This pillow has saved my life! My hips, back, and neck pain were eliminated the first night! It's like sleeping on marshmallow clouds. Shoot, I'll be sleeping with this pillow even after the pregnancy! Love it!"
b"Gave this as a Christmas present to my daughter in law (due in July).  She loves it!  My son also loves it!  I asked if I should buy him one also - haha - but he said it wasn't necessary because he works shift work, so they trade off.  It's getting a lot of use.  Anyway, it was a big hit - the best of all the Christmas presents!"
b"My husband had been wanting a body pillow for years, but was very particular about what kind he wanted. He's a big cuddler but, unfortunately for me, his body temperature runs at approximately 450 degrees Fahrenheit, even in the dead of winter. I love him to death, but the last thing I want on a 90 degree humid summer evening is his body anywhere near mine.Insert this pillow.I purchased this for him at Christmas and it was the best purchase I've made to date. It doesn't take up more than his half of our queen bed and he can cuddle it on nights when it's just too darn hot. The case is easily removable and washable, but takes a bit of work to get back on, but it's definitely doable. Highly recommend this product for all of us out there whose significant other loves to be big spoon but who's body temperature is similar to the surface of the sun. This pillow is a God send!"
b"It did not do well for me but that's personal. I can see how this pillow would do wonders to other people though. I personally just didn't like it and I don't think anything can make me feel any better with my big pregnant belly at night with the back pain. this would be great for others I'm sure though so I'm giving it five stars."
b'I\'ve been using this pillow for about a month. I rarely review anything but I must let you know, fellow pregnant ladies, that I just love, looove this maternity pillow. "U shaped" is the only way if you, like me, move and change sides and positions while sleeping. I was a bit worried about it being "too soft" for my liking but is not, it\'s just so comfy. I\'m so happy I got this!'
b"I am so satisfied with this product. It has kept its shape (not flat), it is very comfortable, more color selection would be nice but don't let that keep you from getting. It hasn't helped my insomnia but at least I'm comfortable while wishing I could go to sleep!"
b'Super.  Recommended by a caregiver for my wife. Just what she needed.  Soft cover (removable for washing), good length for her 5 foot tall frame.  Content can be fluffed up to avoid flat spots.'
b"This was a godsend, can't believe I waited so long into my pregnancy to get it! Does get warm, but overall great support and easy to wash the cover. I liked that I didn't have to move it when I turned from side to side since it's the same on both."
b'My husband and i loved the first one of these pillows so much that we had to buy him his own puredown pillow as well!! We both sleep SO MUCH BETTER! I would buy this again 1000 times if i could! The cover washes so easy, a little annoying to put back on but the pillow really has made my pregnancy and pregnancy discomforts way more enjoyable especially when trying to sleep. Also makes for a great snuggle pillow since my spouse works rotating shifts!'
b"I purchased 2 different body pillows from Amazon and this was the keeper.  Perfect combination of soft and firm for a body pillow and to be used as a head pillow.  No need to fluff or reposition it when turning to the other side!  Yes, it takes up a  good portion of the bed but it is amazingly comfortable.  I'm able to have support for my belly, back, head, while lying flat.  Prior to this pillow I was up all night, totally uncomfortable.  I had tried everything and this has been the only thing to work!"
b"So very comfortable. I wish the top part of the pillow was firmer, but I use a regular pillow under it. The color isn't as dark as depicted in the photo, either. It's more yellowish when I expected khaki/taupe, but it's no deal breaker. The pillow itself gives great support under my belly and my back as I needed. Great item for pregnant ladies, and, anyone that needs additional pillow support."
b'I am not pregnant but holy cow I love this pillow. It\xe2\x80\x99s like sleeping in a perfect fluffy nest. Even my cat likes it. He smushes himself between the pillow and my back. We are fans.'
b"It did not do well for me but that's personal. I can see how this pillow would do wonders to other people though. I personally just didn't like it and I don't think anything can make me feel any better with my big pregnant belly at night with the back pain. this would be great for others I'm sure though so I'm giving it five stars."

b"Not as thick as I expected it to be or as shown in the picture It didnt expand as it should've, but not bad for body pillow still comfy. Update: 8/15/2018. Even though I didnt exchange the pillow or return it. The company wannafree is great they contacted me with options to satisfy me with my purchase which I wasn't expecting. I really appreciate their service never happened to me before so yes I recommend buying from them I know items sometimes don't come as they should, but they are willing to replace or work with you to be satisfied which is awesome."
b'What can I say, I love the feeling of being propped up and supported in general but even more so when pregnant. I have had other \xe2\x80\x9cpregnancy pillows\xe2\x80\x9d in the past and felt like I was missing something in the comfort department, I purchased this one and have slept so well and perfectly cradled.The box arrived and I was perplexed, but upon opening you can see how well packaged this pillow is during shipping. It fluffed right up and even offers a washable cover with hidden zipper. Now it has an internal for the filling as well if you need more support by I find it comfortable as is.For those that like to sleep on your side but need something behind you and in front of you for balance and support, this is a fantastic option.'
b'Purchased this pillow to help with back support while sleeping.  It\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable and fits nicely propped against my back with the other side between my legs supporting spine alignment.  I like that the pillow covering comes off making it easy to wash and keep clean.'
b'Pillow is large with plenty of length for full body coverage. Great for pregnancy! Has an outer pillow case with zipper closure that easily removes for machine washing! Would make an amazing gift for any pregnant woman in your life or for yourself as a large snuggle pillow!'
b'I bought this pillow because of a meme that was like "I\'m not pregnant, but dang I want one cause this looks comfortable!" And I was like same!! Lol. It\'s super comfy. If it was socially acceptable, I would carry it around in public like Linus in Charlie Brown with his blankey. No joke.'
b'I love the way the pillow shapes your body frame. and the neck part is so amazing. I do wish the side pillows were thicker.'
b"This is the most comfortable pillow that I have ever slept with! It helped me sleep so much more peacefully and there's so many different things you can do with it! Very nice quality and material."

b'Was too thick for my stomach and was uncomfortable. But then I had some congestion and used it behind my regular pillow to prop up so worked out in the end. I am still using it to add height so giving 5 stars eve mb though I am not using it as intended.'
b"This pillow literally has made sleeping so much more comfortable. I haven't been sleeping well because of this big old pregnant belly and regular pillows are too thick to slide under my belly. This pillow is perfect and has seriously helped me sleep better!"
b'This pillow is amazing! The angle and length make it very cozie! The cover zips right off for easy hand washing! I love this pillow!'
b'This is saving my sleep time at noght'
b'Good'
b'I love this pillow. As my belly got more heavy it was harder and harder to sleep comfortable. So when I got this it made a huge difference. Got it around 3/4 months pregnant. I chose this one because I sleep really hot and I didn\'t think I could sleep with a huge body pillow. Just sounded too hot. So I\'m very glad I went with this wedge. So worth the money. I\'m telling all my pregnant friends its a "must have"'
b"I absolutely love this pillow! I use it between my knees at night. I am not pregnant. It's very comfortable"
b'Love this wedge! It is soft, supportive, and easy to clean. Can also use under a regular bed pillow to elevate your head if you are stuffy!'
b'bought this for the wife, the wife really love this. she said sleeping with this pillow help her back pain a lot. thank you for the recommendation from the seller.'
b'Soft and durable. Other color options would be nice.'

b"This pillow. THIS @&?$! PILLOW. I could die happily surrounded by this magnificent pillow. I'm going to spend so much time cradled in her loving embrace that my family will call the police to do a welfare check on me because I've disappeared from society. I'm probably going to be less productive at work due to my constant daydreaming about this pillow. My entire bedroom game has changed. This is the year of me AND THIS IS MY PILLOW."
b'I see that some people have had a bad experience with these types of pillows. I scrutinized myself about whether or not I wanted one, let-a-lone what brand I wanted, for several hours. I compared the pillows by reading all about the product information I could find along with all the reviews for each pillow I was interested in. I finally chose this one. Although, I am not sure where they come up with it being 19 inches thick, it is quite lofty, and I love my pillow. I asked for it for a Christmas present. It is one of the best Christmas presents I have ever received. I am 5\'6.5" tall, over weight, and the pillow is perfect. It is the right length, the right width, and just the right thickness. I love the way it surrounds me. I use it every night. I was also able to get a pillow case to go with it. It is very soft and I love it as well. I received care instructions prior to receiving the pillow for customer service. It stated to put it in the dryer for 5 min. with no heat. I did so, but it barely fit my dryer, so I used the other set of instructions where you just shake it and fluff it up on your own. I did let it sit out for a couple of days before I used it and so far have only had to redistribute, and fluff it up once. If you are looking for a great pillow to use for pregnancy, for extra support, or for Fibromyalgia, like me, then I would suggest this pillow. Especially now that it is less than what I paid. Looks like it has gone down in price, just under $10.00. Maybe I can get a refund for the difference. LOL. Good luck with your search and "May The Force Be With You."'
b"Pillow arrived a few days later than expected but still within reason. Packaged well. It deff needed to be fluffed out from being compressed in the box but it didn't take much. First photo is straight out of the packaging after being fluffed for a few mins. Next two on my king bed. Third showing the pillow case I had made for it using the sheets of my choosing to match my bed set. This pillow is nothing short of amazing! I have nerve issues that affect my right arm and hand causing extreme pain and numbness. I also have back issues. This pillow helps keep me aligned properly while I sleep. I am waking up less and my hand has not gone to sleep on me as long as I position myself properly and keep my shoulder elevated. This pillow makes it easy to do that and gives me plenty of options for position. For the price, I am 100% satisfied and will be purchasing my Daughter one very soon. In my opinion it's plenty thick enough and nice and cushy! Highly recommend!!"
b'I am nearly 5 months pregnant and have had trouble sleeping.  This pillow is like a g*ddamn snuggle nest!!  This is incredibly comfortable and I highly recommend purchasing this bad boy ASAP.  We have a full size bed and there is just barely any itty bitty room for my 6 foot hubs, so be warned this thing is HUGE!!! But oh my goodness. I wish when you found out you were pregnant it rained these pillows for you and all pregnant women in the world.  I cried I was so happy to find sleep relief (could have been the hormones, too).PS I have pregnancy carpal tunnel and this has brought relief to those morning symptoms.'
b'It showed up at my door on time, and I could not wait to try it out!  Since I am a Senior with arthritis and take a nap every day, I used it the same day.The pillow is not overstuffed, is shaped straight with no built-in curves, so it is easy to re-position as needed to support neck, shoulders, and legs.  It is much easier to adjust as one big pillow than to fight with 4 or 5 separate standard pillows.  The pillow cover, which is included in this model (cheaper competitors did not) has a long nylon side zipper, which makes it easy to take off and wash.This model was just the right length for a short person. (I am just under 5 feet tall)'
b"I'm no where near pregnant but have been suffering from serve back pain lately. This pillow is perfect for back pain. I wake up from a good nights rest minus the pain! It fluffs up nicely after you follow the directions in shipping box. It does say to put in dryer (without heat) for 5 min to fluff or to hand fluff for 5. I just hand fluffed and it is amazing ! Deff buy the pillow even if you're not expecting it's worth it ."
b'I ordered this same pillow 3 years ago. The one I previously ordered was full, fluffy, comfortable and large. The one I just bought is half the size,uncomfortable, and far from fluffy. This products quality has changed.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in love with this pillow already!! I\xe2\x80\x99m snuggled up in it as I type this. :) The pillow arrived two days early and has exceeded my expectations so far. When I first opened it up I took the cove off and washed it, then proceeded to beat the snot out of the pillow per the directions. (I don\xe2\x80\x99t have dryer balls or tennis balls so I had to do it by hand.) I let it rest for a little and by the time I was ready for bed (about 12 hours later) it was SO fluffy. It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect about of fluff/firmness for me. My head doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sink straight down but it\xe2\x80\x99s not being pushed up either. I sleep all over the place (back, both sides, stomach) and usually I wake up often to adjust my pillow but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen once with this! I\xe2\x80\x99m so, so happy with it. Even the kitties like it :)'
b'This says "maternity" pillow but, in my opinion, is selling it short.  Last May, I had rotator cuff surgery. I\'ve had many surgeries as I have brittle bones, but this was different.  It was done the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend.  I live alone and had an allergic reaction to my pain meds ... but it was a holiday weekend and there was nothing I could do except make myself comfortable.  I managed to arrange my many bed pillows (grandkids love coming to Grandma\'s cause she always has lots of good pillows, blankets, etc.  Pillows were my salvation.  My third child, a daughter now 36 was diagnosed with breast cancer last Thanksgiving.  She underwent months of chemo and had a mastectomy last Wednesday.  Inasmuch as the location of her surgery was exactly where mine was last year, I wanted to make sure she could comfortably support her left arm without exposing her to accidental trauma.  As is my practice, I came to Amazon to review pillows and after lots and lots of research, I chose to purchase this for her recovery.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  The reviews said it was large but very comfortable.  I had the package deliverd to her the day she returned from the hospital.  She was so thrilled ... she could finally get comfortable and feel protected.  Anyone who has had or may have any surgery which may affect your abdominal (et al) muscles, please consider this pillow.  It\'s much easier to sit up from a prone position when your sensitive area is not only protected but affords you mobility without any additional discomfort (i.e. straining already taxed and sore muscles).  Again, thank you from a mother who loves her children.'
b"I got this pillow in my first trimester. And it was one of the best investment of my pregancy.The pillow is huge. We have a queen bed and it largely takes my entire side with me in the middle. I am 5'5. I also sleep with 2 other pillows for my head and I use this one for my body.I have restless legs syndrome which was more frequent and worse when pregnant. Getting my legs comfortable was my number one reason to get it. As the pregnancy advanced, this pillow helped with backaches and supporting my growing belly as well.Through the pregnancy, I tossed in my sleep a lot, but the pillow made it so convenient to be able to find a comfortable position and go back to sleep fairly quickly.I used to be a belly sleeper before my pregnancy. However, with this I can position the pillow to allow me to sleep on my knees which I loved to do when I got closer to my due date.The pillow is white and comes with a pillow case which can be easily unzipped for cleaning. The pillow is very fluffy. It is not full to the max so it's perfect because you are able to adjust it and articulate it however you want to, to fit your body and your comfort level."
b"I have had problems with sleeping all night even with sleeping pillsSo my first night using this pillow I slept the intire night and I even slept the next day by this time I was thinking I wouldn't sleep that night which I also didI have tried many many pillows and I kept 5 different pillows on my bed switching on and on was awake most of every nightnow for the first time without sleeping pills even I can really sleep a whole nightHappy I found this pillowI love it I love it best sleep ever I got the chocolate one it's fussy blanket type"
b'I saw an equivalent of this product for twice the price, so I was glad to see a more reasonable price.  I know that it is detailed as a "pregnancy pillow", and I am not. I ordered two of these, one for me and one for a Valentine\'s Day gift for my love. I placed my order prior to Christmas, and was concerned about it sitting outside of my apartment while I was out of state. Well, it arrived prior to my departure on the 22nd. I have been impressed with that aspect, and the product itself. Get more than one of these. You\'ll get a wonderful product for yourself, and be a most popular gift giver. You can remove the paper that says "pregnancy pillow" from the bag first.'
b"I seriously love this thing. I'm actually on my second pillow. My first one accidentally ripped open in the wash (totally my fault for overstuffing it). after the first one broke I actually ordered 3 other pillows and ended up sending them back because they were so uncomfortable. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time because this pillow is the best! It is super easy to adjust and i love that I don't have to take the pillow with me when I turn on the middle of the night...which I do quite often at 6 months pregnant. It is really long so it doesn't take much bending for my legs to get over it. It is really really big though. So if you don't have a king mattress make sure your significant other is ok with getting a much smaller portion of bed for a while . the only thing I would change if I could is the case it comes with is not so great.  For the price I wish they would include a nicer cover."
b"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. That's right. This product isn't just for pregnant women. My husband wanted a body pillow and while doing some research I discovered this product and the great reviews made me think it would be a lot better than a regular body pillow. He absolutely loves it. The only problem is this thing takes a lot of space and I find myself fighting it many times during the night. That thing is stubborn though. It won't stay on his side :) Well, I've made my bed, now i have to lie in it. It is great if you have back problems, which many people do. I like to use it when I'm using my computer in bed. I get great support for my back. The filling does get clumpy in time, but I just shake the pillow occasionally to get the filling to distribute evenly as much as possible. If you're buying this as a gift, you should probably just gift wrap the box that comes from Amazon, because once you remove the pillow from the box, it becomes huge and it's pretty hard to gift wrap."

b'This is my new bed buddy for my King size bed! My pillow arrived promptly on time and was packaged with perfection! It had no harsh chemical smell and  was surprised how big the pillow actually is. I am a side sleeper and with this wonderful pillow the first use already has relieved my lower back and hip pain. It is huge, and really does cradle your whole body.It is whole body supportive and, not so heavy if one had to move it aside to move or get up from bed.If you are pregnant or suffer from fibromyalgia pain, had surgery in an area that needs that extra support" then this would be an ideal pillow for you. The photo in the ad. is exactly what the pillow looks like\' and a bonus is the zippered case that can be washed easily.Miracles are hard to find\' lucky for me I found this one!'
b"I bought this as a gift for a stripper, and now she rarely shows up for work because she never wants to get out of bed. Granted, being a stripper, there's a chance that it's just the result of crippling depression, but I'm pretty sure it's because the pillow is so comfy. She said she loves it."
b"Package arrived within 2 days just as promised. Was vacuum-sealed in box and bag as expected. The instructions say to shake for 5 minutes or to place in dryer for 5 minutes on no heat with 2 tennis balls to fluff; BUT the pillow instantly fluffed once out of the bag. Can be shaped in any way and is very flexible. Lightweight makes it very comfortable at night and material is breathable so no hot flashes (except when the fan isn't on).I've read complaints about sleeping on your neck being uncomfortable. Because this pillow is so large and flexible, you can either bend it to shape your neck or scoot down a little and place your own pillow in the middle.Overall; I'm glad I didn't rely on the few bad reviews!"
b'I am obsessed with this!  I use a regular pillow for my head and then have this pillow in a "U" shape at my feet.  I am newly pregnant, was only 8 weeks when I bought this, but I am happy I bought it early.  When my center of gravity started shifting my back was killing me, but using this pillow has helped a lot.  When I bought it instructions came that recommended putting it in the dryer to fluff it up.  Well it did not fit in my dryer, but over a few days it fluffed up fine on its own.  I have washed the cover and it held up just fine on a normal wash.'
b'This body pillow is absolutely amazing. I had found one on a maternity type site for at least double the price. It is so great for pregnancy you can.  Wrap it all around your body in between your legs behind your neck; and instead of it being at least $90 on a specialty site, it was way less on Amazon and it was the exact same thing'

b'Nice wedge pillow for under my daughter mattress.  I love the support it gives her when she sleeps, since she needs to sleep with some elevation.  The cover is soft, very plush and the pillow itself is also very soft.  It is a little smaller than i thought it would be but it fit in her bed perfectly.  My only complaint is that it was too soft for any support to my lower back and leg issues.  I need something with a little more density to it.  Overall a decent plush wedge pillow.'
b'I got this pillow for my lower back. The cushion between some of my lower discs is pretty much non existent and some nights I cannot get comfortable no matter what I do. This has offered me some relief. It takes the pressure off of my lower back by giving it a bit more support. I really love how SOFT this pillow is and the fact that the cover can be removed to wash'
b"Just what I needed to finally get some sleep! I have been dealing with bulging discs for over a month and haven't been able to get comfortable enough to sleep. This has saved my sanity! I finally was able to sleep for more than 5 hours over the last few nights since this has arrived! I can prop my knees up with it while laying on my back to relieve pressure off my lower back, or place it between my knees to also relieve pressure on my hip and lower back. It is super soft and not extremely bulky. I love that the cover zips off to make it easy to wash!"
b'This wedge pillow is amazing.  Totally worth it.  I put off buying one for a long time because it seemed like such a pregnancy gimmick to need a "special" pillow when I had throw pillows of all shapes and sizes, but this has been one of my favorite pregnancy purchases.  It is comfortable, high quality, and extremely versatile; I am sure I will use it after pregnancy, too.  Different uses so far: between my legs to make sleeping on my side more comfortable; wedged in front of me to support my pregnancy stomach; wedged behind me to keep me from rolling onto my back (the only thing that has worked, by the way - different pillows just ended up beneath me or pushed back); behind my head while reading; under my legs to elevate my feet.  Really great product.'
b'Love this! I love the versatility to use it as needed for neck, back, or extra belly support when laying on your side. It also helped me sit through 3 8-hour training days by giving me extra back support in my chair.'
b'I actually purchased this post pregnancy because I used a whole body pregnancy pillow while I was pregnant.  I shopped around for wedges because my baby has reflux and the infant reflux wedges are triple the price I paid for this. It fits perfectly in her co-sleeper and i love that the cover is removable so I can wash it. As far as safety goes, I will slip it under the "mattress" and test it as she naps throughout the day before I use it a full night. The vendor shipped it out soon after I ordered it and I received it quickly and in pristine shape.'
b"I bought the Boppy for my first pregnancy and I found it just a bit too soft. This one is nice and supportive for my second pregnancy. I'm 7 mos right now. And the cover is so soft and comforting. I also tried it behind my back and I love it. Highly recommend."
b'Totally Fine Transaction, Thanks. We would buy product again if needed.'
b'Amazing! Get two! One for your legs and one for the bump.'
b'Nice'
b'Works great as a seat cushion.'
b'Just what I needed and great to sit on for post parturm.'
b'This pillow was great during my second and third trimester I used it every night. After my daugther was born I washed the cover and now use it to feed her, and she loves it.'
b'During my pregnancy this was the BEST pillow ever. Now my LO liked to lay on it.'
b'Best pillow Ever!! Firm but not too firm. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up a lot of room in the bed like big maternity pillows! Great for the couch too!'
b'I bought this mostly cuz I suffer with heartburn during pregnancy but this pillow helps with that perfectly and is nice and soft'
b'Bought it for my wife and she absolutely loves it!'
b'Love it'
b"This item is pure magic!  The restful slumber that is achieved is unmatched by any other product of this kind.  The design and quality is unparalleled.Now, to be honest, I'm not pregnant nor am I am woman.  I'm just a 46 year old beer chugging, pizza loving guy who loves naps.  Granted I've not been to the gym since Reagan was in office and some might question my fitness level, but I'm sure you will love the Dr Flink Pregnancy Memory Foam Wedge Pillow when resting with your little bundle of joy inside of you.  The pillow can also be used to prop up a 12 pack of Miller Lite while watching the Red Wings with your favorite friends.  Rest assured, if you spill beer, nacho cheese, or the errant chicken wing, this delight is machine washable."

b"This pillow comes vacuum packed so I had to let it sit a couple of days until it fluffed back up to its natural thickness.  In the meantime, I took the cover off to wash it.  Taking it off was a chore the first time and I had to have my sweetheart help me, as well as putting it back on.  It's a bit like putting pants on a dummy or something.  I'm sure that, like most things, it will get easier with familiarity.  It laundered well in warm water and didn't shrink at all in the dryer.  The zipper at the top is well sewn and meets in the middle with two zipper pulls so you can unzip each direction.  Surprisingly, the pillow didn't have any smell to it when it arrived like some do.  The material inside the pillow is very soft and it's about 8 inches thick throughout (see photos).I did not buy this pillow as a maternity pillow.  I have regular pain in both of my shoulders and often it's almost impossible to get comfortable at night.  After far too many sleepless nights, I started looking for pillows to wedge under them at night.  That's when I found this maternity pillow, which works really well at supporting both shoulders at once.  The headpiece is high enough that I can roll completely over on my sides and have enough depth for my shoulder to lay naturally instead of being scrunched up at all.  It also works well to lay partially on my side to support my back or to lay completely on my back and place a shoulder on each side of the pillow for support."
b"Super comfortable. My quality  and length of time of straight sleep has drastically improved. I currently have frozen shoulder since September of last year. Forced to sleep on back as a result. This pillow helps to keep my shoulders level and comfortable throughout the night. Great for easing anxiety, knee pain, back pain, and fibromyalgia. Also great for my pregnant daughter. She can't sleep without it. This is the second pillow I have gotten. My family is addicted to it, and slowly, each member is buying one."
b"I recently had a double mastectomy and am currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments. This pillow has been a lifesaver! I primarily use it to keep me comfortable while sleeping on my back. It keeps my arms elevated, and I can keep one of the 'legs' under my knees for lower back support. I have not washed the case yet, but it looks fairly simple to remove."
b'This pillow is so absolutely comfortable in any and all positions!'
b"This pillow is amazing. It is incredibly comfortable!!!! I highly reccomend for moms-to-be!!! Also, it's a great gift!"
b'Love it, husband and kid fight over it.'
b'I love it. It\xe2\x80\x99s more flat then a round pillow but still very comforting.'
b'This is very soft. It also is warm, can only use the the ac on.'

b'This is the best thing ever and my review is long overdue. When I was pregnant with my daughter back in 2015 and decided I needed a pregnancy pillow, I was going back and forth on getting the mini or the regular sized Snoogle, but I figured since we have a queen sized bed, I\'m only 5\'2", and I enjoy my own pillow, I would get the mini. It has been one of the best purchases I\'ve ever made and I cannot recommend it enough. Not only did it help this strictly stomach sleeper get through having to learn to sleep on her left side comfortably through that pregnancy (I use it like the second photo, curve between legs, length under my belly, and my own pillow), but it also came in extremely handy for its bonus uses, particularly as a NURSING PILLOW! I used it for 18 months to nurse my daughter. I also have a Boppy for this purpose but honestly prefer my Snoogle to it. The Boppy slides out from around me at times which is hard when you have a younger baby, but the Snoogle securely wraps around with no worries of it sliding out, and it makes a great support for all positions including football since it wraps the entire length around you. It also offers some back support while nursing which is really nice. Seriously, this pillow has been a life changer for me and I am now using it again as I\'m 5 months pregnant with our son. It has flattened a little in some areas, but it\'s held up quite well overall and I intend to use it for nursing again. The cover can be a little difficult to get on after washing, but my husband and I manage, we just kinda work it on and pull it up like a nylon. I would most definitely purchase it again if it flattens out too much.'
b"I wasn't sure this pillow was worth $40 but I'm glad I finally broke down and bought one. I'm currently 32 weeks pregnant and have been using a plain body pillow which was working fine until I started experiencing back and hip pain every night. I'm usually a side sleeper so I figured I'd have no problem with staying on either side but it's been increasingly difficult and the body pillow just wasn't enough support anymore. I used the Snoogle Mini for the first time last night and slept better than I have in weeks! This actually kept me up on my side and when I did roll onto my back, I was supported and my legs didn't go numb. I like that this pillow can be turned in all different positions and I can switch from side to side easily throughout the night. I also really like that it's small enough to wrap around me and support my back when I want to sit up in bed and my husband doesn't feel smothered by a million pillows! I'll probably use it as a nursing pillow as well once my little one gets here. Overall, very happy & rested pregnant lady right here!"
b"This is a lifesaver for pregnant ladies trying to adjust to sleeping with a baby bump. I bought this at the beginning of my second trimester and it is honestly the best maternity purchase I have made. Before using this pillow I would toss and turn all night and have a hard time staying on my side to sleep. My doctor as well as everything I've read, advises pregnant women to stay off their backs at night to help with circulation. After waking up several mornings with my legs and arms asleep and tingling I knew I had to do something. This pillow is not only cozy and firm, it provides wonderful support and has allowed me to sleep on my side with ease. It's also great for helping to prop me up in bed to read or watch tv.  Another bonus is that it can be used as a breastfeeding pillow (although I haven't done that yet)  On several occasions I've taken this pillow on overnight trips and although it is large, it is still easily transportable and makes me feel cozy no matter where I am."
b'I went back and forth about whether or I needed it but after finally getting it i am so glad. I was always a back sleeper so this kept me sleeping comfortably on my side. Pillows never worked for me. I picked the mini because it is cheaper and a better fit sharing a queen bed with my husband and dog. It\'s not big enough for me (5\'8") to have under my head and between my knees but that was ok with me.'
b"I have multiple chronic illnesses that cause pain, fatigue, and insomnia. I needed something to help hold my body in place when I finally find a comfortable position in bed, and to keep joints in place when I sleep on my side. This is perfect. It's comfortably firm, and works excellent for helping me keep comfortable on the sofa or sitting up in bed.As to its size, I'm 5ft 4in, and 240lbs. I have an average length torso. When laying on my side I can fit the short curve under my head, the length along my torso, and the longer curve between my knees. It's a little tight, but no problem. I can't wait to try it in the car on my long rides to my Dr's appointments.I may get a longer one if I have another surgery. If you're going to have intensive surgery and be in bed for a while, this or a larger one would be a great idea."
b'I am 5\'2" and this works perfectly for my second pregnancy. I had borrowed my friends regular sized one of these for my first pregnancy and it was too big. So I am excited they made the smaller version for smaller people. Very happy and would recommend it.'
b"I am currently 16 weeks pregnant, and this has made side sleeping so much easier! I've been using it for about a month now. I had been waking up with terrible shoulder and hip pain, and that's mostly gone away, because the pillow adds support so that your entire body weight is no longer on those spots as you sleep. I stay asleep more now, too, because of it. It's not so huge that it takes up half the bed, either. I had to learn how to maneuver it to get out of bed in the middle of the night to pee, but it only took a few nights now it's no big deal. I like that it has a removable, washable cover. I plan to use it after pregnancy as a nursing pillow."
b'Now having this pillow for a few months, I\'m not sure what I would have done without it! It makes sleeping so much better especially now that I\'m 8mo pregnant. The size is perfect for me (I\'m 5\'4") but borderline too small so if you are taller, you might want to consider the larger pillows. I really didn\'t want another pillow or something taking up much room but trust me, it\'s worth it. I like that I can bring it camping or just to use on the couch in addition to sleeping with it in bed. I also am looking forward to using it with the baby soon. It\'s nice to be able to get so much use out of it.'
b"I am writing this review on my husbands account that we share.  I used this during my pregnancy and it helped me to fall asleep quickly and stay there.  Even though I am not pregnant anymore I still use this pillow during the night and I just can't seem to get over how well it works.  The cover that comes with it is troublesome to get back on but is a nice tight fit so you can't complain too much there.  Overall I definitely recommend this product especially to those women who are just getting that baby bump and you can not find a comfortable position no matter what you do."
b'So I purchased this when I was a few months pregnant and used it throughout my pregnancy (my baby is about 3 months now). I loved it and would not have been comfortable in the last trimester without it. I actually really like that it is "mini", as we have a queen bed and I do not think a big version would fit in the bed with me and my husband. I am also a "mover" when I sleep, and this was small enough that I could easily move it from side to side as I flip through the night. I used my own pillows for my head and used the big curve of the J between my legs. The one thing in doing it this way - I had to smoosh in the top little part so it would fit along my belly and not "poke" me in the boobs, but it was easy to do.'
b'This pillow is exactly what I needed. I can\'t sleep well unless I\'m on my back, and I\'ve reached the point in my pregnancy where I can no longer sleep comfortably on my back. This pillow gives me the back support I need to sleep comfortably on my side. It comes with a guide that shows you all the ways you can sleep with it (and you can use it as a nursing pillow, too!). I sleep with it tucked between my legs and wrapped behind my back, and it\'s perfect. It\'s not too small at all, and I\'m 5\'9". You will need a pillow for your head, but I was planning on sleeping like that anyway. I use this, and one pillow behind my head, and I\'m good. It\'s just the right size so that I don\'t have to invade my husband\'s half of the bed (our mattress is queen size).'
b"I already have the full size Snoogle, and it was rather uncomfortable for me, so I was looking for something smaller that I could turn with  me throughout the night and which would not serve as a pillow. This mini Snoogle is perfect! It is compact enough that it doesn't take that much space, so I can comfortably share our bed with my husband. It is small enough that it's easy to turn from side to side, without having to completely uncover the blankets. And it does not have a section to be used as a pillow, which was a huge deal for me, since I suffer from migraines and have my own pillow that I want to use. I find this pillow extremely useful and much more comfortable than the larger body pillow. It definitely accommodates my growing belly and helped a ton with my back problems."
b"LOVE IT! I am 5 months Pregs & ordered this pillow after tossing & turning every night for months. Kicking myself for not having discovered sooner! I have no actual aches or pains (yet) :) but I can tell how this would be helpful if I do. I was feeling a bit of tightness in my lower back & again, just uncomfortable; tossing and turning all night, never falling into a deep sleep. The day I got the pillow I was initially disappointed, not quite sure how it worked? Well, you figure it out quick! :) Best drooling nap EVER! That night's sleep was the best I've had in months & I dreamed all day the next day for that afternoon's nap! I set it between my legs, laying on my side. It gives me great support between my hips, the one curve hugs my tailbone & lower back area; which was feeling so tight. It also, creates a long snake part across my front giving me a nice cushion to rest on & hug. (I straighten the other end so is straight, rather then curved, as I like laying on my actual pillow) It allows you to shape as to what feels best. My feedback; WELL worth every penny! I debated whether to get the compact or full & like the other ladies who reviewed I am really happy with the compact. I think the full size would have been just too big & awkward to move when moving & turning in the night. I like to sleep close to my hubby; which this allows. Compact is perfect size in our queen size bed with hubby & 2 bed hog kitties!:) I would purchase again!"
b'Love love love this pillow, this is my first pregnancy so I waited a while to order a body pillow as I did not know if I would actually need one. I received it when I was around 4 months pregnant and I am obsessed. I cant sleep without it now! I debated between this mini pillow or the regular pillow, I am 5\'2" and was 115 pre-pregnancy and this is the perfect size! Highly recommend for any expecting mothers out there! I also love that it can be used as a nursing pillow once the little one arrives.'
b'I loved my snoogle! I got the mini because my husband and I sleep in a full size bed and there isn\'t a ton of room. This worked great. I\'m also petite, 4\'10" so I really didn\'t need the bigger size. If you\'re petite and pregnant this is a great option. I will say that it is a pain to get the cover back on when you wash it.'
b'Love this pillow and so does my 11 month old son!'
b"My wife: Made a big difference in my sleep during pregnancy. Seemed nuts to spend over $70 on a pillow for the full size version and so glad I didn't. The full size ones must be huge and take up the whole bed, but this size isn't too in the way for my husband and still seemed like the perfect size for me. There's actually a few different ways you can position it for sleeping but once I found the right one for me, I've definitely been sleeping really soundly. Since you're supposed to sleep on your left side when pregnant, it sort of helps anchor you into sleeping on that side, but comfortably. It contours around your body and having it between the knees really helps my hips. True, the fabric of the pillow case is a little rough but it's so comfortable, I fall asleep pretty quickly and don't really notice. Also, seems like it will be great for breastfeeding comfortably. Would definitely recommend and buy again."
b'I bought the full size snoogle when I was about 5 months pregnant and became so dependent on it that I could not imagine how I was going to live without it on a recent trip.  Along comes the mini snoogle - Brilliant!  I purchased the mini snoogle and had it sent to the hotel where we were staying and was very pleased with how well the smaller size imitates the benefit of the larger snoogle.  It kept me upright and on my side, and supported knees, hips, belly and head while also being small enough to squeeze in with everything else we brought along.Update - I left this at my folks house in another state and realized upon traveling there with my little one that it works pretty well as a nursing pillow.'
b'I got this pillow over 4 years ago while pregnant. I chose this as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a pillow for my head just everywhere else. I usually sleep with a pillow between my legs so this was perfect. 4 years later and not pregnant and I still use this pillow. It goes everywhere with me. I am coming back to order a new one since my current one has broken down from daily use.'
b'This is a wonderfully priced pregnancy pillow! It is very easy to get comfortable with, and great for back sleepers, as it can be used to give extra back support. It can be turned into an "O" shape, allowing for third tri mom\'s to lay on their stomachs and get a massage. The "O" shape can also be used as a pillow to sit on for postpartum healing. The covers seemed a tad pricey to me, so I just took a large strip of material and sewed two lines, creating a long narrow pillow case- for free! It comes off easily enough (although I\'m sure a zippered one would work better) and washes just fine.'

b'I will never ever be without this pillow.. I have back and joint pain and slept with several pillows tucked here and there and woke numerous times during the night to readjust but not with this love...they need to stop advertising it just as a pregnancy pillow as that may turn some people off...it really gives good back support and hip support.  I am vertically challenged my children say...but even if one is not, as some said it was to short for them you can just put a memory foam or other soft pillow at the bottom and that will hold your feet and ankles just fine...I work on my feet on concrete for 12hr shifts and I hurt at the end of the day and really look forward to crawling into my pillow.  If you want to read before going to sleep just put a thick pillow under your head and shoulders and you are in a padded recliner chair.  I have not had trouble with the zipper as some said but even if I do I can easily replace a zipper, especially at this price.  I touted it on facebook to friends and I know three people who bought it and are also raving about it.  That beer belly is the same as a baby bump when you think of it.  And best of all...this has the Fred seal of approval....Fred is my great dane and he likes his memory foam and I have to fight him for this pillow.  Wish I could put the picture up of him in it....  Oh...received in a few days and fluffed it up with no problem....my daughter got a e mail telling her to put hers in the dryer  with a couple of clean tennis balls with no heat for a few minutes to fluff. it.'
b'Posting this on behalf of my wife...who LOVES this pillow. She\'s had this pillow for several months now and uses it every single night. She loves it. It allows her a much better nights sleep over her "C Pillow" that she had last pregnancy.Some things to note:1. It\'s BIG. If you don\'t have a king size bed maybe think about your sleeping partner who likely won\'y have very much room for themselves. We have a king and while it\'s not a little pillow we both still have enough space to sleep comfortably...which is good cause I\'m 6\'3" and my wife is 5\'10".2. I haven\'t snuggled my wife literally even one night since she got this. So plan accordingly if you\'re the spouse. They\'ll prefer this pillow over you 10/10. But they will also get a better night\'s sleep with this pillow so they\'ll be more pleasantly refreshed in the morning? Toss up if you ask me.3. I\'m surprised that it has kept it\'s form to be honest. It\'s durable...probably for multiple pregnancies.'
b"I absolutely love this body pillow!  I am currently 20 weeks pregnant and have been using this pillow for about a week now.I had originally bought the Snoogle, based on great reviews, but I found it way too bulky and firm - which made my hips hurt - and too awkward and large to roll over in bed with.  So when I saw this pillow, it was a breath of fresh air!  I can actually roll over in bed now without having to lug a huge pillow with me!!  It's also a lot flatter and much softer than the Snoogle, so it works for me - doesn't cause me hip pain.  My only complaint is I wish it was a little longer to support my ankles too, but it's not a dealbreaker by any means.I have arthritis and a herniated disc in my lower back, so this pillow is great for back support!  I will be using this pillow long after I give birth.  I've been wishing for the past couple of years for a second body pillow to prop up my back, so this is really a godsend - an all in one product!  I am so glad I found it.This pillow was a little awkward at first to figure out how to sleep on and where to put my arms, but I've gotten the hang of it and have found what's comfortable for me after breaking it in for a few days.  I still am able to use my pillow with this when I want, and it's great if you have reflux at night like I sometimes do - using your pillow with it will prop you up at an angle.  It's comfortable even without using my pillow.My cat loves this pillow too!  She sleeps on it with me, and it's great bonding time :)  I've also found her using it while I'm not home, so have had to keep my blanket over it.All around great product.  I highly recommend if you need back support or a flatter body pillow to keep your hips aligned."
b'Amazing pillow! My kids love it too!I do have to put another pillow under my head, but would purchase again in a heartbeat. Well worth the money!*** Not as amazing as I originally thought. I used this for about a week, and when I unzipped the cover to wash it, the pillow inside had huge gashes in it and the stuffing was falling out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t originally noticed because the cover had not been removed. However, I did contact amazon and they told me to send it back for a full refund. I do plan on replacing with the same pillow because it is so comfortable. Just hoping the next one isn\xe2\x80\x99t ripped to shreds \xf0\x9f\x98\xac'
b"This is.The Best.Pillow.IN THE WORLD.No really...my husband wants one all to himself.Ok, so it's really big so hubby is gonna have to get over it. YOU can finally sleep comfortable through most of your pregnancy. This pillow came with me to my parents AND to a retreat 10 hours away from home. Yes... it was that important.THEN after I gave birth it was FANTASTIC for breastfeeding! I would fold one leg under the top part so it would prop up. Then I could sit/lean back in bed while nursing in the middle of the night. I usually fell right to sleep with baby.At this point the pillow has had a lot of use and abuse and I will probably need to order a new one for baby #2. But seriously...don't hesitate on this purchase!"
b"Flip it around and you can use your own pillow with it! I tried the original way and my neck hurt the next day and I got a headache, but flip it over and use the open part for your head so you can use your own pillow and it works great! Very comfortable! Better than the snoogle and other wedge pillows, I've tried them all! This one was the best thing that worked for me, especially the last 2 months! Love it!!"
b"I love my pillow so much my husband is now jealous. I was having a lot of trouble sleeping due to pregnancy induced carpal tunnel.. Yes that's a thing. I couldn't sleep on my side because my hands would go numb, I couldn't sleep on my back because I couldn't breathe. This pillow allows me to sleep slightly tilted and provides support everywhere I need it (my back, my belly my arms, my neck..) I had been using a whole bunch of pillows but during the night they would shift all over the place and sometimes gal of the bed making it very difficult to get and stay comfortable.This pillow definitely gets a thumbs up from this pregnant momma!"
b'THIS . PILLOW. IS. AMAZINGI\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pregnant and still have my body pillow from than(7yrs ago). This pillow is what dreams are made of and happiness feels like. I really cannot put into words how much I love it. I have degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, and sciatic pain. This pillow has stopped 99% of the pain and makes it comfortable to lay down.'
b'A must have. We swapped out the fleece cover with a cotton case as the weather got warm. Great for pregnant, also great for laying down and breast feeding. I even took this to the hospital after the baby was born, it was a comfy cocoon that securely keep mom and baby all snugged into place.  As it gets colder now, swapping the fleece back on soon! We have gotten tons of mileage with this, a must have for our experience.'
b'This pillow is a life saver. My pregnant wife complained her back was hurting a lot and so we got this pillow to help with her sleeping posture. It\xe2\x80\x99s helped her sleep more comfortably when she\xe2\x80\x99s on her side and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need any additional pillows. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any happier, well, only if I could stop snoring.. jokes aside, I think I want to buy one for myself now.'
b"I couldn't have survived pregnancy without this pillow. My husband complained about it being too big, but I didn't care because it kept me so comfy every night. I did feel like the head rest was too high for my neck so I turned it upside down and used my own pillow. It still kept me from rolling on my back and kept everything supported. Best money I spent while pregnant for sure!! I was worried it wouldn't be like the picture, but it totally is! Fluffy and wonderful."
b"I can't believe I waited as long as I did before getting this. If you're on the fence about whether it will help you during your pregnancy, get it. It really does help you sleep better. I can't sleep without it now. I put a pillow under each arm. That allows me to press my belly into the arm to stabilize it, preventing it from sagging down painfully on the bed, and also lets me lean back on the arm behind me when I need a new position."
b"I call this pillow, my cocoon.  It envelopes me in cushioning.  So wonderful!  I have Charcot Marie Tooth, a hereditary type of peripheral neuropathy.  I have a lot of pain, & recently my arms & shoulders have been really bad.  This pillow helps that a lot.  I find I am turning over less, & waking less.Also, I don't know what the thread count is for the pillow case, but it is SO smooth & soft!  I highly recommend this pillow, & it's certainly not just for pregnant women.  Although, I wish these had existed back when I was pregnant!"
b"Best thing I ever bought for myself!! It's kinda hideous and it takes up most of my queen sized bed....buuut....I get the best sleep ever with that cozy beast!! I have a herniated L4 and L5 and sleep can be very difficult....this was life altering!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"After trying 3 different pregnancy pillows, I absolutely LOVE this one!I turn a lot during the night and this is the only pillow that gives you full support from both sides.Now, about the husband.... he can sleep on the floor for a few month :) it's very big, we have queen bed and it takes a lot of space BUT I still won't replace it."
b'When I first bought this I was only a few months pregnant and did not really understand the concept of it. I had terrible back pain during my entire pregnancy from get-go. My third trimester I found this to be the most comfortable thing possible. I slept great! My husband did not like it, but he delt with it until the baby was born. I used it for a while after my baby was born but it went in storage after that. It allowed me to have my own comfortable space to sleep, which was like heaven to me. It allowed me to lay ergonomically correct with my belly propped on the pillow. Without the pillow my back would be twisted wrong and uncomfortable.'
b'bought it for another purpose:  I have some sleep apnea when I sleep on my back.  this keeps me on my side so I don\'t need a cpap machine.  won\'t work for everybody but it sure helped me.  my sleep score went from mild apnea to normal with this pillow.  again, I\'m not trying to "cure" anyone\'s health problems, but it sure helped mine.  it\'s a very comfortable pillow'
b'I love, love, love this pillow! I purchased it to help get some relief from hip pain and needing like 12 pillows to get comfortable at night. All I need is this and a blanket. The fabric is soft and easy to wipe off (I was worried with it being white it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t last in my house of three toddlers) it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to clean and maintains its shape after many uses.'
b"This pillow was a lifesaver for my wife and is actually more useful now that the babys born for nursing or naps. This is a must buy for C Section mothers. I'm jealous and may buy one for myself for days when I'm sore from work. The cover with a zipper is nice."
b"I purchased this body pillow in January. It is now July & I can tell you I still love this pillow! I use to use a Temperpedic pillow which I really liked for neck support. But this pillow gives me neck & body support & it certainly was a lot cheaper..This pillow is not just for pregnancy! Wish I would've discovered this pillow years ago!! The pillow case comes off easily for washing. It is a large pillow & well worth it!"

b"I put off purchasing a pregnancy pillow because they're all so fricken expensive and it's just a pillow!! I had been using a body pillow but I wasn't getting sleep and it was getting worseSo at 30 weeks I gave in. This one was cheaper but still had favourable reviews.It arrived pretty fast, and didn't take 2 days to inflate back to size like others I've seen.I've been using it for about a week now and I love it!It's long enough for me to tuck between my knees and still cuddle up to and I dont have to constantly move it around when I want to flip over.I was a back sleeper pre-pregnancy and was having issues constantly ending up on my back in my sleep using just the body pillow.With this, even if I roll back in my sleep I'm still propped up and not causing myself future pain.It also helps me get comfortable sitting in the chair in the living room which helps me believe it will be as versatile post partum as it claims.The only negative I would have to say about this pillow is if you have anything smaller than a queen bed, your partner is sleeping on the floor. And I get really warm at night and this pillow seems to reflect some of that heat back.I dont think I would trade it for any other one I've seen, especially for the price point.If you're on the fence about buying a pregnancy pillow I would definitely say this one is worth it"
b'Very comfy my wife loved it! I was very impressed with speedy delivery!'
b'Very soft, comfortable and helps me sleep so much better at night!'
b'Wonderful product. Not pregnant but helps my back greatly. I sleep on it every night. Kind of big and bulky but worth it.'
b'I love this pillow! I have been sleeping a lot better through the night with it. It came in decent timing and it looks exactly as pictured. It is thick and fluffy enough for me so I have no complaints as of now. I would recommend!'
b'Great my sister loved it and she left at my house and now I want one'
b'Comfortable and supports your back.'

b'I am almost 12 weeks pregnant and though I had often considered getting a pregnancy pillow as I got further along and my bump grew, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t put much thought into buying one this soon. However, nausea and indigestion have been butt kickers for me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve found some relief propping myself up at night (unfortunately my husband tosses and turns and literally throws pillows in his sleep, so this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly successful for me). I ended up getting one of these on a whim and I\xe2\x80\x99m obsessed! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for about a week now and been nausea and indigestion free at night and in the morning. I now drag it around whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m lounging. I seriously would recommend purchasing this if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the fence, I love it!'
b"I am borrowing my husbands Amazon account to write this review cause this is a pregnancy must have. I had never really put much thought into spending money to buy a pregnancy pillow. However by 24 weeks I was having trouble sleeping, tossing and turning at night and having more constipation issues. Left side sleeping helps with digestion and It was hard for me to stay laying on my left side, it was not the most comfortable. I came across this pillow and it has been a huge life saver. Not only is it comfortable and soft, it has helped improved my sleep and helped with being able to lay and sleep on my left side. My body fits in it nicely with it being a C shaped and it supports very well. Can't beat the price and ships in an timely manner. Highly recommend for those who are pregnant!-Jess"
b"A great and comfortable pillow to help keep you on your side. I have always been a back sleeper and when I found out it wasn't advisable during pregnancy I was a little worried.  It does a great job of keeping me on my left side while also keeping me comfortable though the night.  The memory foam is comfortable and doesn't get to hot. The removable washable cover is very convenient and also soft to the touch.  Over all I definitely recommend this for comfort and value.  You won't find this high quality a pillow for a lower price."
b'I had a rounded pregnancy pillow for my first pregnancy, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any different from a body pillow. This pillow is the shape of an angled C, which allows for your head to rest without putting pressure on your shoulder, while also elevating your top leg so your hips are in proper alignment. I\xe2\x80\x99m a wild sleeper and this pillow keeps me on my left side because the long edge of the pillow acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cbig spoon\xe2\x80\x9d :). My husband is also getting more restful sleep because I\xe2\x80\x99m not moving around at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited to continue using this pillow as my pregnancy progresses. My sleep has significantly improved. You also cannot beat the price. I highly recommend!!'
b"Great pillow! I'm in my last trimester of my pregnancy with twins and this pillow helps my back and hip positioning so much! It's a heavy pillow, so it doesn't slide out from under you. It has a soft cotton covering over the pillow. I can fit completely wrapped up inside the pillow and my back is completely supported. This has been a wonderful item to have, especially since sleep and comfort left my pregnancy a long time ago!"
b'Great price at the mall they wanted $69.99 for the someone!'
b'Got this for my wife and she loves it, our 2 other kids try to steal it from her because they love it too. To be honest I actually thought of ordering another one for me too it\xe2\x80\x99s super comfortable.'
b'I absolutely love this pillow! It\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievably comfortable! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I would like the shape of it because I thought have of my body wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have support but the curves at the end support me perfectly! I\xe2\x80\x99m normally a tosser and turner but I don\xe2\x80\x99t toss very much when I use this pillow it\xe2\x80\x99s only a few times a night.'
b'It took a day or two for the pillow to even out because it comes wrapped up but once I let it sit layed out it worked perfectly! It\xe2\x80\x99s super comfy, I lay it under my little bump and it evens out my posture so I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up with back and neck pain. Definitely going to come in handy in the third trimester!'
b'This pillow is amazing and I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that enough! It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like memory foam and it\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than the snoogle I had with my first son. I would buy 20 of these before I ever bought another snoogle definitely worth it'
b'Great price at the mall they wanted $69.99 for the someone!'
b"Amazing, so comfortable, perfect size. I was afraid when I received it, it didn't look super stuffed, but it's perfect and nice and squishy! I sleep so much better with this pillow."
b'Very cozy pillow. Fluffy and the perfect length. Arrived on time, very shortly after the order was placed.'

b'Purchased this for my pregnant girlfriend. Comes in a vacuum sealed package. Must allow it to expand for 2 days before use. It has become her favorite pillow. Pillow is soft and large enough to keep her comfortable. It is very bright white. Wish there were more color options. Will update review  when it becomes flat for longevity.'
b"This is a unique U-shaped pillow with a detachable extension piece. It comes in tight plastic packaging so it takes 24-48 hours to fluff out on its own and reach it's full potential. It is a very large pillow and has a shape on the inside of the pillow that contours to your body. The pillow offers generous neck support and extreme comfort. You can easily fold the detachable extension to offer additional support under your head or neck if needed. The pillow is very large and measures 56 inches long by 36 inches wide.This Maternity pillow makes a great lounge or sleep pillow for anyone, not just pregnant women. The only con to this pillow is that I can not find a case to fit it. It does come fitted with a zippered cotton pillow cover. This pillow easily replaces 4 pillows I typically use behind my head and between my legs to sleep at night."
b"I have bilateral hip Osteoarthritis, and prior to making this purchase,  I wasn't sleeping well,  waking up in pain. I am a side sleeper only.  Anyways this pillow was worth every cent! Hey,  if you have arthirtis like I do,  fibromyalgia,  lupus,  or RA I would say you will find pain relief with this pillow."
b"One of the best things I've ever purchased for my pregnancy and it has improved my quality of sleep so much. An amazing price and an awesome product. Probably needs a better cover, but other than that this thing is such an amazing gift to pregnant women!"
b"Took me a little while to configure this pillow in the best way for my sleeping preference, but love it now that I have!  That is no fault of the pillow, just remember everyone is different and has different pregnancy experiences, especially when it comes to sleep.  I purchased this a few months ago but wanted to wait to post the review until I could say whether or not I was truly satisfied.  I'm now 7 months pregnant with my 2nd child - never got a special pillow the first time around and ended up sleeping upright on the couch in my late 2nd trimester and beyond.  Very poor sleep with my first pregnancy.  I will note that the head portion is somewhat flat, and I have found that I am much more comfortable with more elevation, particularly since heartburn is an issue for me in the later months.  However, this is an easy fix - I just put my regular pillow on top of the head portion of this pillow, and it's perfect - just the right elevation to keep me asleep without having to sleep sitting up.  Couldn't ask for better sleep while pregnant."
b"I'm not pregnant, but I purchased this pillow anyway to support my back. I am sleeping so peacefully at night. I love that one side is detachable. This pillow is so versatile!"
b'(Pictured on a king size bed) Opened it and let it sit out and fluff up for a day and a half and I am satisfied with my purchase! It\xe2\x80\x99s not flat at all. The only flat part is the pillow part for your head, which I am actually glad it is made that way so that I can use my favorite pillow in conjunction with it. I would not want to use a full cotton pillow for my heard part as I like to use my comfy memory phone pillow. Use your pillow along with this and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be great! It looks like it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come with a cover, but you can actually unzip the whole thing and take off the outside \xe2\x80\x9ccover\xe2\x80\x9d and wash it. The other people must be confused. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for 2 and a half weeks and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ripped yet!'
b'My wife loves this pillow.  We have tried this pillow for almost 45 days.  She was having a difficult time at night sleeping during her second trimester of pregnancy.  The twisting and turning to find a comfortable spot on the bed didn\xe2\x80\x99t help with regular pillows. This pillow works wonders, every night she uses this pillow underneath her stomach, if she wants to read a book she can position the pillow upwards and be more comfortable and not be in a tight spot and put strain on her stomach.  I love this pillow too.  This pillow is very comfy, I work about 16 hours a day and when I come home I use this pillow to sleep on.  It has helped me improved my sleeping.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t snore as much as I used to.  It truly feels like you are sleeping on a cloud.  The down side to this pillow is, it\xe2\x80\x99s very bulky and takes up a lot of space on the bed.  For example, we have a queen size bed and one pillow takes 2/3 of the bed.  I use my pillow on the floor for sleeping on a hard surface and be comfortable at the same time.  Washing is easy, just throw it in the washing machine and you are done.  Hope this review helps.'
b'This is truly wonderful! I\xe2\x80\x99m 6 months pregnant and have had a hard time sleeping through the night. I tried to stay away from purchasing a pregnancy pillow (was using a multiple pillows to prop myself up) but I hit a low and needed some rest, badly! And I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I finally purchased this! Best sleep I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in months! We have a King sized bed, so the area space it takes up is not a concern for my husband and I. Most reviews said to let it fluff for 24-48 hours, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait when it was delivered. So I manually fluffed (as you would any pillow) and I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I love that the cover is easily removalable and washable. Just wish I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought it sooner!'
b"Oh my gosh. What would I do without this pillow?? I was pretty skeptical about maternity pillows, but I have slept so great since using it. I was waking up throughout the night with a ton of hip and butt pain before, but now I only wake up to pee or roll over.PROS: I love the upside down U shape as opposed to the C shaped pillows or body pillows because then you don't need to worry about bringing the pillow with you when you flip over in the middle of the night.  You can also wedge one side under your butt and back while you sleep on your side and have the other part of the pillow between your knees. It zips too so it's easier to wash.CONS: Even though it's sufficient as is, I was kind of expecting the pillow to be more full and fluffy. It definitely does the trick though.  I also wish there were other colors available other than sterile white. Kinda looks like it belongs in a hotel or hospital. Even just a tannish color would be nice."
b'Sleeping has never been better. That is the response I got when asked how they liked the pillow. She loves it. Still up and down to the bathroom but getting back to sleep is not a problem. Could not be more pleased with this purchase.'
b"This was a gift to my pregnant daughter in law.  She was having so much trouble sleeping and couldn't get comfortable.  She LOVES the pillow but my son does not - they have a queen sized bed and it takes a lot of room, he's sleeping in the guest room for the duration of her pregnancy, LOL!  He knows it's worth it in the long run. Happy wife, happy life and all that!"
b'My only regret is not purchasing this pillow sooner! I have been suffering from pelvic floor pain, and now at 30 wks my lower back constantly aches. This pillow has made such a difference! I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up super sore anymore, and I am getting such a good nights sleep. It is super versatile as well, I use it while sitting in bed on my laptop I curl the pillow around my back and up on my lap so I can rest my computer on it! Such a great buy!'
b'I bought this to train myself to sleep on my back and it worked. Very soothing and comforting. Felt enclosed but pillow was soft and comfy. Gave it to my pregnant daughter in law afterward but might buy myself one anyway. It is big though and will take up space in your bed. Need a queen or bigger'
b'Pleased with this product.  I like that the cover comes off to wash.  I use it every night and it holds its shape.  Great price.  I have purchased 3 of these pillows.'
b"Love this! 5 months pregnant with sciatica/shoulder pain and this has been great so far! I aso like the detachable side as it's super easy to fold up when getting into bed rather than having to crawl over the pillow. Definitely would recommend :)"
b'Love it i have back injury and fibromyalgia and it works great for me . i love the fact that i can un zip it and used it in any shape i want'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve only used this 2 nights and am so happy I ordered it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant, but have back and hip pains from sports and running and this pillow supports me in all the right places at night so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up in pain. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty big in size but is easily \xe2\x80\x9csquished\xe2\x80\x9d to take up less space on the bed.'
b'bought it for my daughter who has back problems works great'
b"I've been dealing with hip and back issues for some time now but my wonderful husband bought me this body pillow for Christmas and the results were immediate! No more pain and I'm sleeping solid for the first time in recent memory. It's a must have!"

b"Started off on the fence, but now my wife loves it.I bought this pillow for my pregnant wife (who is very picky by the way), and at first she liked the way it cradled her, but complained about not being able to use her regular pillow in conjunction with this.  However, fast forward about a month and she has ditched her $100 deluxe-memory foam pillow and uses this exclusively.Pros:Very comfortable and my wife enjoys using it in different ways.  I will often find her sitting in it on her phone, kind of like a plushy inner tube, then at night she will sleep on her side and this kind of cradles her.Cons:The only complaints that I have heard from my wife at all, was that compared to the gel-cooling pillow she was using, this one tends to be a bit warmer, not a deal breaker in the winter though.This complaint is actually more from me (the husband) than anything, but this thing is huge.  We used to have a queen-sized bed, which was already a little small, then she brought this home, and my half of the bed turned into a third.  We have since upgraded to a king-sized mattress (she bought it because she felt bad for me), and now that isn't a problem, but buyer beware.Conclusion:The only thing that really matters here is comfort, and this thing provides that for my wife.  Occasionally before this pillow, I would wake up and find my wife sleeping on the couch or another bed because she couldn't get comfortable.  That hasn't happened once since we got this.  Sure, you husbands will have to share a bed with now effectively two other people, but as long as the wife is comfortable right?  By the way, I tried laying with it once and it is very comfortable, but don't tell my wife."
b"Oh Snoogle, how I long to lay with you and drift off to a comfortable slumber....I love this pillow! I am currently 9 weeks pregnant and have been suffering from leg cramps (which I have suffered with prior to pregnancy as well). This is my second pregnancy and did not use a pregnancy pillow for the first, which was a mistake. I shopped pregnancy pillows for a couple weeks before deciding on this one. It cake down to 4...the Snoogle, Leachco Grow to Sleep, Coolmax PP, and the Lotus Leaf Pregnancy Sleep System (which was quickly ruled out once I got a grip and realized paying $200 for a pillow was ridiculous considering my grandmother bared 9 children with no fancy fluffiness). I chose this one based on reviews and size. The U shaped just seemed too big even though we have a King bed but after you throw a 220lb hubby and 2 year old in the mix, it just didn't seem sensible. So, I ended up with the Snoogle. Love it!!pros:The jersey cover is soft and breathable, easy to remove and clean.Oh so comfortable and easy to maneuver for max comfort.Right amount of supportPromotes side sleeping but still comfortable if you end up on your back.Con:Wish there was just a little more fluff where my knees land.Makes it hard to get out of bed...cause I am too comfortable!"
b"This pillow is the only thing that helps me sleep on my side during pregnancy, and I only wish I had gotten it sooner. It's so comfortable to snuggle up with and provides full body support. My arm never falls asleep even if I tuck one underneath. I also find that if I want to switch sides during the night, there are enough comfortable configurations that you don't necessarily need to flip the whole pillow over. It is quite large, so it makes a bit of a tight squeeze in a queen sized bed with my husband, but still very manageable. My only real complaint is that the fabric has pilled where it is used most often, which is a bit of an irritant."
b'I have two boys, so this pregnancy isn\'t my "first rodeo". With the previous pregnancies, I remember awful back pain and hip pain from having to sleep on my side. Not so with this one!Because of this pillow, I can comfortably sleep on my side. My husband doesn\'t complain much (though I have awakened to see him sleeping in the guest room because I took up too much of the bed. Ha ha). Right now at 17 weeks, my favorite position is to have the curve of the pillow at my back, the top curved around my shoulder supporting my neck, and the bottom through my knees keeping them at a comfortable distance. I feel like I\'m being hugged all night long, and it doesn\'t raise my skin temperature to uncomfortable OVEN temperatures like snuggling with my husband does. I let him borrow it one night because of his back pain, and he said he didn\'t want to stop snuggling with it either.'
b"LOVE. I am 16 weeks pregnant and have been using it nightly for about the past month and a half. It's been so great already, I am excited to see how helpful it is as my pregnancy progresses! The cover is very easy to remove, wash, and replace. The fabric is soft and fortunately, doesn't collect hair from our dogs or fuzz. We loved it so much that we purchased a second one for our almost 3-year old daughter's bed. It is the perfect guard for keeping her in bed!!! No more rolling out! Now my husband is begging for his own HAHA! Highly recommend for pregnant women, children that role out of bed, or the general pillow lover! Highly, highly recommend."
b"I am updating this review after using the Snoogle through my whole pregnancy and for at least one month postpartum.  If you are a back or front sleeper, do not hesitate to buy this!  It is worth every penny! I bought it when I was 5 weeks along, but it improved my sleep dramatically the first night, and continued to be crucial for a good night's sleep through the end of pregnancy.  I hauled it along on a cross-country trip when I was 6 months pregnant because I couldn't imagine sleeping without it.  I hauled it to the hospital for labor.  It served as a breastfeeding pillow for the first few weeks.  I still needed it for sleep for a few weeks after birth as well, as my body adjusted.  It was absolutely the best pregnancy support item I purchased for myself, bar none.I am not a natural side sleeper, but pregnancy requires you to sleep on your side, especially as your belly grows. This pillow supports you so that you can kind of sleep tilted towards your back or front, taking some pressure off your knee and hip.  Sure, you can get support from a pile of pillows, but with the number of nighttime bathroom breaks you'll take in your third trimester, you want to be able to adjust yourself back in bed to fall asleep again in a hurry.  I could just slip back into bed, moving the pillow swiftly around my head and under my leg, and I was asleep again in no time.  The pillow is big, but curled around me it didn't really affect my husband's sleep in our queen-sized bed (though he was happy to see it finally leave the bed when our son was a month old).Is it hot?  Well, I was sleeping hot, but it wasn't because of this pillow.  I was huge and due in August.  I sweated on this pillow nightly, and it needed to be washed on a fairly regular basis.  The jersey cover stood up to weekly washings pretty well.  I wouldn't consider this a long-term pillow option, but pregnancy is a pretty difficult time.  Sleep is precious.  You need it and your baby needs you to get it, and this pillow is why I was sleeping well at all.I did not need an additional head pillow with this because I felt that it supported my neck really well.  In fact, I usually have issues with my neck and often get stiff necks, but this was the perfect support and I didn't get a stiff neck any day that I used it."
b"Wouldn't have been able to make it through my pregnancy without this pillow. Some reviews have said that this is pricey. However, I purchased this pillow within the first 12 weeks of my pregnancy and use it every single night. It is definitely worth every penny! The cover zips off so you can wash it and the fit around your body is great!I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this pillow if you are expecting. I even take it with me on road trips to use in a hotel bed as well."
b'So I LOVE THIS pillow and loved it\'s price. I have affectionately named my pillow "Mr. Bean" and it has replaced my hubby as my snuggle partner! Needless to say, he is pretty jealous, but WHO cares! He is not the one pregnant with twins, and as many pregnant moms to be know, snuggling next to your partner is NOT the same while preggo...we are so badly in need of proper support and body alignment and men usually run so HOT while they sleep. Our hormones are rushing,( and we can get crazy hot flashes) he is generating too much heat, and my lower back kills! Not a happy mama! Enter Mr. Bean...So I researched and researched all maternity pillow reviews on Amazon. Alas, at the end of the day, pretty much even the most gloriously reviewed products have a few one stars in there, so you HAVE to take a leap of faith. Fact was, this pillow has consistently great reviews for a reason. Its a great pillow. (Plus, after a few hours on Amazon getting bleary eyed from reading review after review after review for ANY item relating to pregnancy or babies...would be moms KNOW what I mean- it was time to just make a choice. I\'m so glad I settled on this one.)I have been sleeping on this little gem for 3 weeks straight....here is my assessment...I like that the cover is soft cotton jersey and is removeable and washable, although I havent attempted to remove and wash it yet, and before you go EEEWWW..here\'s why....I followed a tip from another Amazon reviewer who uses a soft cotten jersey pillow case and slips it right over the part where you head rests, and you remove and wash THIS piece weekly, and the outer cover twice or so a month...any way, I digress...the pillow is a good length, and the seam of the pillow that some reviewers were complaining about on cheaper versions of Snoogles that dug into their neck and shoulders while they tried to sleep doesnt happen here. And while its not a fully wrap around maternity pillow like some of those on sale here for 100 bucks or so (which prevents the user from having to flip it over to the other side if you want to change sleep sides during the night) to me, 18 weeks pregnant with twins, and already holding and showing as someone pregnant with one baby would look at 26 weeks or so, this doesnt matter to me, since I get up several times during the night to use the bathroom anyway. I just flip it over when I go back to bed.It is super soft, yet supportive, and I am super picky about the neck support I receive from my pillows while I sleep. I usually use my organic latex support pillow even on top of the head part of this pillow to support my head and neck while I sleep (and to keep my body at a slight incline to help with the dreaded acid reflux) but even if I didn\'t I would still be ok. It provides enough head and neck support all by itself.This pillow also cradles your back yet gives it soft support, and put between your knees also helps with proper spinal alignment. In sum, it helps pregnant mamas in desperate need of proper nighttime support to sleep peacefully and comfortably! It solves all the problems of having to struggle with 4 or 5 regular pillows in order to get comfortable. I also plan to snuggle with Mr Bean even after the babies are born...unless the Hubby decides to hide him from me! I love this thing. Get it, and love it too!'
b"So I'm 16 weeks pregnant & this pillow is like my new best friend. I've had it for about 2 weeks now & used it every night. I got it because my pregnancy was causing a lot of back & hip pain, I was losing soooo much very needed sleep & was starting to hoard pillows, even my husbands. This pillow hs been a life saver, I was a little nervous about the price of it but so far it's completely worth the money. I sleep with it every night (it took a couple nights to find that perfect position for me), I use it when just relaxing on the couch or to prop myself up. some people said they had problems with it wrapping over their shoulder & they didn't like using it as pillow for their heads but I actually really like that part. With another small pillow under it my shoulders aren't uncomfortably crunched together. The size isn't too bad either. My husband & I have a queen size bed & we can easily fit with the pillow & have no problems. Now to figure out how to get it into my suitcase to take home on vaca in a few weeks..."
b"My first Snoogle was ruined during my delivery at the hospital. It broke my heart to throw it away. It was like throwing away an old friend. Now that I'm pregnant with #2, I knew it was Snoogle time. My husband hates it because it's an awkward barrier between us but my hips and tailbone are grateful so he can stuff it."
b"I love the snooggle, this is my second one from amazon... my dog loves it too so i gave her my old one. I'm not pregnant, but i am a side sleeper with back issues and neck problems and this helps tremendously. Its the only cuddle buddy you'll ever need. after my first one almost all of my friends went out and got one, to the point where one of my friends made us all snoogle covers for christmas last year. seriously amazing. warning, if you are in a relationship, they will hate it (because you will probably choose this over them) or they'll want their own."
b'This has saved my sleep since the end of the first trimester, when it started to be uncomfortable to sleep any way but on my side. It is dense enough to retain its shape, offers great support in a variety of configurations, and the cotton cover is soft and cozy.  You can even curl it up like a pretzel, and use it to prop yourself up enough to sleep on your back, if you need a break from side sleeping. I miss it when we go on trips, and do not sleep nearly as well without it.'
b"Simply Amazing! I haven't slept well in weeks! I'm 19 weeks pregnant and I'm up at least 6 times a night. I had to go to a different bed in the middle of the night just to get comfortable... until now!! I used the Snoogle for first night last night. I slept well and didn't leave my bed! It fits my body great! Easy to wash cover. I would recommend this to any pregnant woman! $60 well spent!"
b"I agree the top seam is tight if I push right up on it, but I'm short enough in the torso and long enough in the next that it doesn't really bother me personally.  I find myself really sleeping easier with it, I was waking up constantly, readjusting pillows, etc.  It takes up a lot of room in the bed yes, but I keep it with the long closed side towards the outside of the bed all the time - Hubby works around it to still support my back and cuddle in as we fall asleep, then if I roll at night it supports my back, so it's a win win for us.  Plus, with all the other configurations you can use it for, I think in the long run we will absolutely get our money back out of it."
b"There are not enough wonderful things to say about this pillow. I use it for sleeping it helps my belly and hips not be so sore in the AM. I use for lounging and elevating my feet as well. It's super soft and the cover is removable for washing. I am sure i will be using this long after my pregnancy as well."
b'This has absolutely helped my sleep during the second trimester. I had some serious hip pain and this pillow helps to alleviate a lot of that. I also like that there are different ways to use it depending on your sleep position.'
b'Amazing body pillow, I find it to be a little too stuffed for my liking so I use a smaller feather pillow (my DH calls is my "squish" pillow) for my head so my neck isn\'t too high up. I\'m 5\'4" and this pillow is awesome. Just about into my third trimester and I recommend this to all pregnant ladies! I am a total back sleeper though, and having this gives me something to lean on/stop me from being completely on my back at night so that is a plus too!'
b'I love this product! I purchased it early in my pregnancy, before my belly grew large and sleeping was *actually* uncomfortable. I like that I can use it on both sides and in multiple ways. My husband even likes it so much that he "borrows" it for naptimes.I thought it was a little pricy, but now that I\'ve experienced good sleep with it, it\'s definitely a product I will and do recommend to expecting moms. (and really, all side sleepers)'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m about 20 weeks pregnant and tossed and turned at night...not to mention lots of snoring. This pillow helped a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and very curvy and find this works for me. Any taller and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it would work because it would be hard to keep between your knees because of the curve. I feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s probably perfection for ladies a little bit smaller than me but overall I\xe2\x80\x99m happy. I was pleasantly surprised by all the different positions you can use! see photo'
b"The Snoogle changed my life. I would have never made it through my pregnancy without it!!!! Buy this for yourself immediately. Buy it for your spouse and your pregnant friend. My husband even steals it sometimes it's so comfy."

b"This pillow comes vacuum packed so I had to let it sit a couple of days until it fluffed back up to its natural thickness.  In the meantime, I took the cover off to wash it.  Taking it off was a chore the first time and I had to have my sweetheart help me, as well as putting it back on.  It's a bit like putting pants on a dummy or something.  I'm sure that, like most things, it will get easier with familiarity.  It laundered well in warm water and didn't shrink at all in the dryer.  The zipper at the top is well sewn and meets in the middle with two zipper pulls so you can unzip each direction.  Surprisingly, the pillow didn't have any smell to it when it arrived like some do.  The material inside the pillow is very soft and it's about 8 inches thick throughout (see photos).I did not buy this pillow as a maternity pillow.  I have regular pain in both of my shoulders and often it's almost impossible to get comfortable at night.  After far too many sleepless nights, I started looking for pillows to wedge under them at night.  That's when I found this maternity pillow, which works really well at supporting both shoulders at once.  The headpiece is high enough that I can roll completely over on my sides and have enough depth for my shoulder to lay naturally instead of being scrunched up at all.  It also works well to lay partially on my side to support my back or to lay completely on my back and place a shoulder on each side of the pillow for support."
b"Super comfortable. My quality  and length of time of straight sleep has drastically improved. I currently have frozen shoulder since September of last year. Forced to sleep on back as a result. This pillow helps to keep my shoulders level and comfortable throughout the night. Great for easing anxiety, knee pain, back pain, and fibromyalgia. Also great for my pregnant daughter. She can't sleep without it. This is the second pillow I have gotten. My family is addicted to it, and slowly, each member is buying one."
b"I recently had a double mastectomy and am currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments. This pillow has been a lifesaver! I primarily use it to keep me comfortable while sleeping on my back. It keeps my arms elevated, and I can keep one of the 'legs' under my knees for lower back support. I have not washed the case yet, but it looks fairly simple to remove."
b'This pillow is so absolutely comfortable in any and all positions!'
b"This pillow is amazing. It is incredibly comfortable!!!! I highly reccomend for moms-to-be!!! Also, it's a great gift!"
b'Love it, husband and kid fight over it.'
b'I love it. It\xe2\x80\x99s more flat then a round pillow but still very comforting.'
b'This is very soft. It also is warm, can only use the the ac on.'

b'Very comfortable! Was a gift.'
b'I absolutely LOVE this pillow and I\xe2\x80\x99m not even pregnant. I bought this because I lost 100 lbs and was having trouble sleeping; I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable. After getting the pillow I can maneuver it to give extra support where I need it and I sleep like a baby. I can definitely see where this would have been an amazing product to have when I was pregnant with my kids. I would definitely recommend it, and it came with 2 different covers.'

b'Love these pillows and so do my patients! These are so versatile! They work for my pregnant, postpartum and infant patients! I have a set that were really expensive, and I also purchased 2 of these. The quality is just as great as my other pillows. I wish I knew about these before buying my first set.  With how often patients ask how to purchase these pillows for home use, this price is wonderful and makes it easy for them to buy as well!!'

b"I was looking for a soft and velvety pillow for a while as I suffer from back pain ( and I was looking for a specific design ) so I finally purchased this pillow.  I wasn't sure how small/big it was until I received it.  The soft (velvety side) is awesome, and I love the color and size is perfect. I do feel the cooling sensation. I can use it on my bed, or take it to work with me, as i work in the office. I might purchase another one for my car. Great Quality Pillow. I'm very happy with my purchase, and I will be purchasing again. Great quality and very soft and useful!"
b'I love this pillow! I recently discovered that I am dealing with arthritis in my lower spine. I saw the shape and realized it could be used in a variety of situations where I had to sit up straight in a high or low chair at home or driving in my car. I tried to use it lying down, as support between my lower back and my butt. It feels very cool to the touch which is soothing for me when my back is aching before use.  It helped me distribute pressure which in turn gave me relief, among other things I use, to support my lower back. Definitely recommend.'
b'This pillow was a home run as baby shower gift. I sent it to a friend with an expecting parther. She loved it...and their cat, too!^^  He told me that due to the wedge shape this pillow is really multi-purpose and they would get good use out of it even after the pregnancy.'
b"I LOVE this pillow. I mostly use it for my hot natured little dog to have his own pillow, but he has to get the cats off first. Ha. It's a great wedge firm shape with super soft cover. One side is cool to the touch. I have to get a 2nd pillow since the cats adopted mine."
b'My friend had a pregnancy pillow in her baby shower registry.  I bought this because my friend is having a boy. Well, she loves it. She said she even uses it in the car for comfort. Im glad I made the buy.'
b"I purchases this pillow and could not wait to fall go to bed and try it. I love the fact that it helped with my night sweats. It's very comfortable and worked great. The packing was very nice, to be able to use the bag with handles makes it easy to carry with you.  I wou surely recommend this product to friends or strangers."
b'I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been using this product as much for my growing belly but I use it every night under the pillow I sleep on to help with reflux. Does stay pretty cool to touch.'
b'This pillow was an smart purchase.  The quality is excellent and I use it to ease pressure on my back.  I plan to order another one to keep in the car.'
b'Wow! What a great night of sleep!  The pillow is very comfortable and the cooling gel helps me with night sweats.  You will not be disappointed with your purchase.'
b'Love this design!  Use every night.  Thinking of getting another!'
b'Great product, helped relieve my persistent back pains.'
b'Wife loves the wedge pillow!! It\xe2\x80\x99s been very helpful for her durning her pregnancy.'
b"This pillow exceeded my expectations.  The cooling gel on one side eases my back pain.  The memory foam on the other makes this pillow the perfect combination for getting comfortable at night.  I have had the best night's sleep in a long time, being able to easily adjust the pillow to fit my needs.  Recommending this to all my friends!"
b'I purchased this wedge for my wife who\xe2\x80\x99s had two back surgeries over the past couple of years. This was her favorite Christmas gift as she lounges with it and she uses it for lumbar support in the car. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of getting her a second one so she can just leave one in the car and have one in the house'

b"Works great. Highly recommend this product with the use of the Leachco Back N Belly Contoured Pillow because the cover that comes with the pillow is so hard to get on and off. This pillow cover works great and it's super easy to get on and off because of the zipper. The last thing you want to be doing when you're pregnant is straining over getting your pillow back in its cover. Comfy, looks great, easy to care for."
b'This cover is SO MUCH EASIER to use then the original case that comes on the pillow. This has a nice large zipper opening on the top, which makes removal and subsequent putting it back on, faster and easier. The zipper in no way is a bother while sleeping on the pillow.'
b'Super easy to fit on pillow. Much softer than the original case the pillow comes with. Would highly recommend buying this cover.'
b'If you have the pillow - this cover is a must, the zipper makes it easy to take on and off and wash weekly!'
b'Very comfortable and supportive. Material isnt so the softest so I bought a cover and its heavenly.'
b"Fits perfectly on my Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow!Easy to put on and take off."
b"Love that I don't have to flip this pillow over with me when turning. It's always there for me to snuggle!"
b'This pillow has a zipper which makes it 10 time easier to put on the pillow than the one that comes with the pillow.'
b'Fits perfectly! Thanks!'
b'Now I can easily take the cover off and wash it. Size of the zipper really makes the difference; it runs almost through the half of the case.'
b"Fits perfectly on my Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow!Easy to put on and take off."
b'I love the beige print instead of the white. This pillow is so comfortable.'
b"Love that I don't have to flip this pillow over with me when turning. It's always there for me to snuggle!"
b"Much better than the original.  I don't know why the original exists, its so time consuming to put on."
b'This pillow has a zipper which makes it 10 time easier to put on the pillow than the one that comes with the pillow.'
b"I purchased the Back 'N Belly pillow in 2011 when I was pregnant, and loved it, but hated wrestling with the cover that came with it every time I wanted to wash it. I hadn't been sleeping well for the past few months, so I brought the gigantic pillow back out, and it really helped, but I decided I had to find a new cover for it. This cover is SO much softer than the original (which pretty much sucked), and has a zipper closure. Zipper! Why this wasn't on the original, I have no idea, but it's so nice to have. The color is beige...and well...boring, but I guess that's to match most decor. Works fine for me with my bedding."
b'Zipper is so much easier to put on and when u take it off.'
b'The material actually cooled my skin down once I put it on.  This came just in time for me to use during labor in the hospital.  I love this pillow and the cover.'
b"I love this pillow! I don't think I can ever sleep well without using this pillow."
b'Fits perfectly! Thanks!'

b"This is the BEST thing I have bought in forever. I have been shouting it to everyone. Posting it on my chronic pain site, facebook, I post in the morning how awesome I slept the night before. I have suffered chronic pain for 20 years. Sleeping is incredibly horrible. I have slept every night since I have bought this. I am not pregnant and most people never heard of this. I'm giving this 20 stars. The other pillow on top is from a boho bed spread and pillow case that have gotten 289 likes on my page. I usually get like 5 on anything. lol"
b'I bought this for my daughter, whose first pregnancy was awful! Second one seems worse..! Since this pillow arrived, she said she has had the most comfortable sleep in months. It is giving her the support her back and hips need.. It arrived quick and in perfect condition! Thank you !!!'
b'Love it, not as thick as the pictures show but works for me'
b"I absolutely LOVE this, I've finally got some much needed sleep, I take it everywhere, the only down fall is that it doesn't come with a pillowcase, and the material isn't soft enough for me, also the pillowcase is almost as much as the pillow!!!:("
b'Excellent product works very well!!!'
b'Worked great for my fibomyalgia!! Now hubby wants one, maybe it will help with his snoring.'
b'Wonderful'

b"I am in love with the pillow!! Being currently 9 months pregnant with two XL sons and having a small frame this has been the answer to my prayers! I was having severe sciatic pain along with contractions and was not able get a good nights sleep. Since this pillow arrived I have been able to sleep until 4am and feel well rested in the morning. I haven't had any issues with the size and I am 5ft 4in and the Velcro hasn't made any noise. I wish I had invested in this sooner!!!"
b'Love Love Love this pillow. It comes apart into three different sections so you can use just what you need. It has been a lifesaver in letting me be comfortable. Also the upper portion where your head goes is great to put behind your back when sitting to help with back pain. A friend of mine uses it when she is feeding. I cannot rave enough about this pillow. Easy to clean in washer. I will keep this around for awhile.'
b'This is the second of these that I\xe2\x80\x99ve bought. The fort one is four years old and has gone flat but she loved it so much she wanted another one. I think the washing is what killed it.'
b"When I was pregnant, this was a lifesaver for me. I got to sleep cuddling it and it encouraged me to sleep on my side instead of my back. I had two pregnancy pillows, but definitely preferred this one for it's soft cover and the fact that it can detach the parts."
b'Have you ever seen that scene in baby mamma where Tina Fey jumps in the dumpster to get the pillow back? This pillow is that good. I used it during my pregnancy and my kid is now 3 and I still use it. Best pillow ever.'
b"Detachable parts are really great. I have the regular Boppy pillow from my prior pregnancy, and the pillow was completely useless because I couldn't get comfortable with the weird head curve and the weird leg curve. This pillow is far superior, being detachable and having the hip support part in the center."
b'I am a prgnant lady that never had problem to sleet due to this pillow! Specially now on the 3rd trimester is very helpful, in the begging not so much.'
b'Very comfortable. Since it comes apart you can use all or some of the pieces. I really like how be used back support while sitting too. Also easier to wash since can be separated into pieces. I bought this after it was highly recommended by my sister and have been very satisfied'
b"My wife loves it!!Heck i even used it at one time,  now we fight for it,  need to get a second one!Super cozy!I bought it for her 2 months into the pregnancy, im upset because we should had this baby or no baby!I can honestly say your do dead into your sleep that you don't even move the entire night,  your that comfortable!"
b'This is on my list of "must" haves for pregnancy. It isn\'t technically a necessity, but trust me, it was worth every penny. As of right now, I only use the bottom piece that is intended for your legs. But the small piece at the top supports my belly at least until I need more of the pillow. I probably won\'t ever use the piece intended for your head, because I am picky but I did try it out and it seems very comfortable! I love that this pillow is versatile and will most likely work for anyone. I even kept the back for when I\'m done using it so that way I can store it easily for the next baby. The only 2 small complaints I have are that 1) the fluff separated because I put it in between my legs, but I don\'t think it is ruined, you just have to fluff it back up. No biggie. And 2) that it DOES kind of suck that you have to put so much effort into rolling over, but for me it seems like I would have trouble with that regardless with my growing belly so it is just something to adapt to. My fiance and I use separate blankets for now because of it but that\'s really about it! I hope this helps!'
b'Best pillow ever! Can adjust pieces the Velcro is secure and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even feel it or know it\xe2\x80\x99s there.'
b'I absolutely love it! Wish it were a little longer so i could straighten my legs out and put it between my feet, but I just put a regular pillow between my feet and its fine.'
b"I bought this pillow for my daughter when she told me she was having difficulty getting comfortable when she went to bed. Now, she doesn't leave home without it if she is going out of town to visit.  She told me I was a life saver...lol. I just remember when I was pregnant with her how hard it was to get comfortable as well."
b"Got this for my 2nd pregnancy. Hate myself for bot having it with my 1st!!!! I have slept soooooo well this time around! Can't believe the difference"
b'My husband bought this for me when I was pregnant with our son, and I absolutely love it! I\'ve always slept with a body pillow, so I wasn\'t sure how this one would be any different. I was pleasantly surprised! It\'s so much softer than my other pillows, and I really like that I can take it apart at the velcro and "build" it my way. Definitely recommend for any expecting mommas!'
b'Purchased this in my second trimester and it was a true lifesaver to get comfortable enough to sleep through the night! The only downfall is that the covers and nonremovable to wash them.'
b'Gift'
b'This pillow got me through two pregnancies. It allowed me to sleep as comfortably as possible.'
b"I have been sleeping so well since my Boppy arrived.  Even caught my husband using it, lol.  I'm just barely into my second trimester and I'm already enjoying the befits of my Boppy.  Highly recommend to all pregnant ladies out there!"
b'Wife loves it, so I obviously love it. She sleeps 10,000\xc3\x97 better. Thanks! Great buy! Recommend to anyone!'

b"I love this pillow!  I was a little hesitant to buy it because so many of the reviews said it was too small. I didn't want one that was so large it took up the majority of our bed.  We have a king size, and some of these other pillows out there looked like they would still be too big, even for that! This pillow is perfect! It's not as full as it looks in the picture, but it fluffs up nicely once out of the box. I also put the head part (which is bulkiest) under my feet so that I can use my normal pillow for neck support. I have uploaded photos of it on our bed so you can see how it looks proportionately to a king size. (Photos are the ones with beige comforter and peacock feather piece above headboard.)"
b'It was a much better quality then I expected, the material is nice. Great for the price, nicer than ones at Target that are more expensive.'
b"This pillow is amazing.  I am not pregnant, but I suffer from fibromyalgia and a neuropathy in my leg, so spending any time with my weight pressed into a mattress is dreadful.  However, this pillow has changed that.  It has curves that allow just enough weight to come off of my painful pressure points that I can actually lie comfortably.  It is also long enough that it reaches down to my calves so I don't feel like I have to curl up in a tiny ball to get any use out of it.  It also seems to be stuffed just about right.  It has not compressed significantly since I opened it, and it was neither over nor understuffed when it arrived, so it remains very comfortable.  I cannot recommend this pillow enough."
b'This maternity pillow has saved my behind, almost literally!  Didn\'t think I would need it at first, and thought I could live without it.Don\'t know how I managed as long as I did before.  Purchased this back when hip growing pains got nasty at 3 months pregnant, and now I am days from 8 months pregnant.  Happy I went with this pillow specifically, because I roll over and move a lot when I sleep.  I am 5\'8", and before pregnancy weighed around 140 lbs (currently closer to 175).  My husband on occasion rolls onto it, and my 30lb dog loves to sleep on it too.  It has still maintained its plush that it had when first recieving it.To get an idea of its size...  If I wear this pillow over my shoulders while standing, it goes to mid calf.  I have a long torso, and semi long beefy legs, so personally, I flipped this maternity pillow upside down for sleeping.  My feet/ ankles rest on the bottom of the "u" shape (with comfortably bent knees).  Still use my regular pillow to support my head.  All together assembled, it looks kinda similar to a sports jersey "0".Before this, I was using one of my regular pillows folded over between my legs, and it just wasn\'t cutting it.  The regular pillow kept sliding out, or I would wake up in rigid pain to find it on the floor. (I would have to get my hubby up to retrieve it).  Going to the bathroom, much less changing positions was a tough job.This maternity pillow makes changing positions/ rolling over under the covers/ getting up out of bed waaaay easier and safer!  I like that it keeps me from rolling completely on my back or belly, because I do that a lot in my sleep.  It always nestles and supports me comfortably somewhere in the middle.Also love that it came with an easy cover to wash and dry.  I\'ve already washed it a few times over the few months.Really glad we decided to get this.  Overall, its made my pregnancy a lot easier, safer and comfier.Highly recommend.Note: The attached pic is of the pillow after months of use and washing.'
b'I am 5\'8" and 7 months pregnant.  I was using 4 pillows in various sizes to sleep before receiving this pillow.  Rolling over required me to wake up and resituate.  This pillow is great for sleeping on either side, no wake up required.'
b"I'm not pregnant (wish I'd had this when I was).  I'm like the Princess and the Pea when it comes to my bed and actually my bed is a little to firm, but this pillow wraps around me, I put one side between my knees because I have fibromyalgia and my leg muscles are very tender and it is so comfortable.  I would recommend this to everyone"
b'I bought this for my husband to help him sleep on his side and avoid snoring.  One night he was out of town and I used it and had the best sleep of my life and ordered one for me the next day.  We sleep so much better.  It just makes the bed a little less tidy when we make it, but that is an easy price to pay for such a comfy nights sleep.'
b'This pillow is wonderful! I had previously purchased a snoogle and had to return it as it was too firm, dense, and tall for my neck. This Khomo pillow is PERFECT! It\'s cuddly, squishes, and still provides support. It\'s also not too large for our queen bed. Husband still has "his" side of the bed.'
b"Since I purchased this pillow, I've had the best sleep I've gotten in a long time!  I'm not pregnant but I suffer from neck issues and this pillow works great!"
b'I can\'t imagine pregnancy without this pillow! At 30 weeks life became REALLY uncomfortable for me. I thought I could get by with a leg pillow and other pillow stuffed around me but it just wasn\'t enough to support my aching belly and back. But I hesitated because I felt really bad about getting a pregnancy pillow that would have to share the bed with my husband!I\'m so glad I picked this pillow! I tried a larger, bulkier, heavier version of the U shaped pillow and it was more trouble than it was worth trying to navigate around. This pillow is large enough to offer comfort and support without being overwhelming. My husband says that in my "little nest" I actually take up less space in the bed because I\'m not constantly writhing in discomfort!I am quite petite (5ft1) and this is a really great size for me but it extends well beyond my limbs. I like to sleep on both sides and I can do so with very little transitional effort. I use a soft pillow underneath the rounded U portion at the head and neck for a little more support and I don\'t have any problems with my neck. I also noticed less strain on my shoulders since I started using this pillow.Please don\'t be an idiot like me and wait to get a pregnancy pillow - LOSING SLEEP (while you can still get it)! Getting a pregnancy pillow will not kick your husband out of the bed! Happy wife, happy life! Am I right?'
b'Looks like the picture and the pillow is AMAZING. So comfortable and plush was definitely a good buy, pregnant or not.'
b'This has helped me sleep this pregnancy, I did not thin I needed one of these with my first but I knew better this time around. I recommend this to every expecting mama i know. This thing is a life saver. I am currently 2 days from my due date and am able to sleep like a baby thanks to this pillow. I use it with the opening at my head and use my own pillow for my head, I have found this to be most comfortable as i can wrap around it a little more easily. I love that it supports my legs, and my back, as well as allows my arms to be comfortable as i am normally a tummy sleeper. This also prevents me from rolling over on my belly and if i find myself on my back it is still lifting me up enough to not be to strenuous on the baby or uterus.'
b"I've been sleeping with a pillow between my knees for years, for a bad back. i decided to try this, and I LOVE it! Perfect pillowy density, huggable. Even though i'm only 5 feet,I like that the pillow is nice and long . I can fold the ends in different ways to support my legs,arms, or back when I'm sitting up in bed."
b"This is the most comfortable thing!  I am newly pregnant and this pillow is my best friend.  My husband calls it my nest.  I like to sleep on my stomach or right side and it is best to sleep on left side during pregnancy.  This makes that more comfortable.  I was getting cramps at night before the pillow and now I don't get them anymore.  I may keep it forever (doubt my husband will like that).  It is pretty big and takes up the room of another person in the bed.  Great quality!"
b"Best Buy during pregnancy ever! It was thinner than most pregnancy pillows but it wraps around your entire body so it doesn't need to be thicker! It really helped me get sleep during pregnancy when it is not recommended to sleep on your belly or back! It helped keep me on my sides and keeps pressure off of your knees. I tossed and turned about every hour if not more and there was always the other side of the pillow waiting for me! No fiddling or moving pillows around every time I tossed! I wouldn't get sleep without this pillow!"
b"I love my pillow....saved my neck and my back after a long day at work....it's my cuddle buddy."
b"I have constant aches & pain for various reasons & this pillow has eased that for sleeping. The cover of the pillow is very nice. I just wish I had a pillow case that would fit it. But I love my pillow. I like to flip it so that the head is down at my feet. It's not too thick, doesn't go flat. Just a great pillow."
b'Soooo comfortable! I wish I would have bought this as soon as I found out I was pregnant rather than waiting for the 3rd trimester. This pillow gave me great support during pregnancy in all the right places, and the best part was I could roll over and not have to resituate all my pillows, there was a pillow right there waiting for me! I would definitely recommend this to any pregnant women.'
b'I am not pregnant but I have a belly and I have neck and back pain.  I am also a back sleeper.  I was looking for a one-piece pillow for support and this one works for me.  This pillow supports my shoulders and arms. I do put an extra pillow under my neck. I like that the U shape is slimmer than the other maternity pillows.  It\'s easy to move the sides to get into and out of bed, and my little doggie can fit inside the U too.  If do occasionally sleep on my side, there\'s support, but not really "hugging" like it advertises.I am happy with my choice.'
b"Love this U shaped pillow ... soft and comfortable .... You don't have to be expecting to use this pillow. I had an accident in school hurting my back, coccyx , left arm and foot making it difficult to sleep due to pain discomfort but this pillow helps me a lot \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a\xf0\x9f\x92\x96"

b'The best thing I ever did for myself is buying this pillow.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve held off because there are so many options but finally decided that the \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d shaped pillow was the one for me.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not as bulky as the \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d shaped.  I\xe2\x80\x99m 23 weeks pregnant and this pillow is heaven.  It\xe2\x80\x99s supportive all the way around and the cover is super soft.'
b'Cant live with mout this body pillow. I am 5 ft 3\xe2\x80\x9d and this pillow is perfect size for me. Love that the cover comes off for easy wash and the pillow was plush and sturdy without being flimsy. Well made product and would buy more in the future for gifts'

b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not pregnant but my boss is, so I gave it to her and she said she slept so much better last night with this pillow!

b'Love. Works great. No need to buy a cover as there is already one in there eventhough it may not look like it.'
b'My wife was having so much trouble sleeping and staying asleep and falling back to sleep after the baby wakes her up to pee. After i bought her this pillow she only wakes up twice a night to pee and falls back to sleep right away. She loves it.'
b"Bought it for my wife, she has been using it since 1st trimester. She loves it and sometimes I use it more my naps. We like the bamboo  cover and it's easy to clean. I would recommend it"
b"This body pillow is very comfortable! I am in my second trimester and can't seem to get comfortable at night or on the couch relaxing. This pillow is a game changer. Definitely recommend."

b"I tried several other pregnancy pillows before I ended up with this one. This is the only one out there that I could find that wasn't made to go under your neck/head as well as between your knees. I have problems with neck pain and headaches and needed to be able to use my regular pillow. I am currently in my last month of pregnancy and having been using this pillow every night since about 4 months. I would not be able to sleep without this pillow. With any body pillow it is hard to roll over with it but at this point I am so huge that the rolling over at all is a task anyway. I have had a lot of hip and back pain throughout my pregnancy and this pillow is the only reason I am able to get any sleep at all at night because he it provides excellent support for my both my back and hips.The air flow strap on it was more hassle than it was worth and was usually in the way more than anything so within the first few weeks of using the pillow I made my own replacement cover (without the extra strap thing) for the pillow out of an old sheet and it works much better without that thing. Although the air-flow strap was a bit of a nuisance I still give this pillow 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be able to use their own pillow under their head and still have a contoured body pillow to put your arms around and the curve to go between your knees. This pillow is also excellent for putting behind you to allow you to lie on a backwards angle without actually lying on your back. I bet this will also come in very handy once baby boy arrives to provide support during breatfeeding, either way I'll be holding on to this pillow long after pregnancy as it is the most comfortable body pillow I have ever owned and tried quite a few over the years!"
b"Oh, Preggle. How did I ever survive my first pregnancy without you?!Seriously, I'm not sure how I did. I absolutely love this pillow, I have taken it with me everywhere throughout this entire pregnancy, even if I was only going somewhere overnight. I struggle with restless legs even when I am not pregnant and, during pregnancy, it is out of control. The curve of this pillow is just the right fit, the long part supports my belly while the curved part fits between my legs and helps me get comfortable. I specifically did NOT want a long body pillow that would reach all the way to my head so, if that's what you're looking for, this is NOT IT. This pillow is not long enough to comfortably use as a pillow for your head and your whole body, it's just not designed that way. I am wayyyyy to picky about my pillows to ever think of giving up the ones I have. That's what I love about the Preggle--it does its job perfectly without interfering with my normal head pillows.I also use this pillow during the day to get comfortable when sitting up--with the curved part behind my head/back, it is very supportive and cozy. Plus, this pillow will be wonderful for breastfeeding; I've already tried out a few positions with it and I'm very happy that I won't have to buy a separate breastfeeding pillow.**UPDATE**I love this pillow EVEN MORE now that I've been using it for breastfeeding! It took me a little while to figure out how to best use it for breastfeeding; at first, I was letting the long end just kind of lay uselessly next to me and only using the curved part to support my little one. But then, on a whim, I tucked the long part behind my lower back for lumbar support and bam! I fell in love with this pillow all over again. :) But seriously, I couldn't be more pleased with this pillow, it was worth every penny."
b'I used this pillow my whole pregnancy and absolutely loved it!!! My boyfriend bought it for me since I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable at night and my back was killing me. This really helped me sleep so much better. I started telling all my pregnant friends that they need this in their life. It kind of hogs the bed a bit and my boyfriend felt neglected since he likes cuddling and I liked cuddling with this but I was completely happy. I read complaints about putting the case back on and honestly those people would probably complain as well if the case was too loose, just have a tiny bit of patience I got it on (and I hate putting cases on pillows), so you can too.'
b'Oh, this pillow is remarkable-- it\'s easily one of the best things to happen to me! I\'m not pregnant, but I am in chronic, all-over pain that makes sleep difficult and unpleasant, at best. I\'m in bed a lot. Having a comfortable pillow is essential to me, and finally-- after years of searching --I\'ve found one! This works in so many positions and is ultimately malleable enough to serve all your sleep purposes while still being plenty supportive enough to keep you comfortable while awake and, say, propped against a wall or headboard. I need good back support, and it delivers. At night, I need a good-sized but soft-enough pillow (that\'s still supportive)  between my legs, and this works perfectly. I almost want two at night: one for my legs, and one for my head and neck!Only potential downsides are, 1) it\'s pretty large, so if you share a bed with someone (especially if said bed is on the small side), well, they may grow to resent it! and 2) like all pillows, if you\'re rough with it-- constantly molding it into extremely bizarre and improper shapes while you sleep (oh yes, I do), it\'ll eventually start to get a little floppy and weak at its "joint" areas. That\'s really a given, though.All things considered, I love this pillow, and highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble sleeping, or experiences discomfort in their own bed.'
b"Update: I wrote my first review a week after I received the preggle in 2011.  It is currently July 2018 and I have never stopped using it!  It has gotten me through two pregnancies and everyday in between and after. I have lower back and leg issues and this helps me feel better in the mornings. I love it. I do feel that after 7 years of continuous use and multiple washings it is time to purchase a new preggle. It has become a little deflated. I am looking forward to my new one. Great product and great quality.i have only had my preggle a little over a week now, but so far i love it.  while i still have lower back pain, i find that it is not as bad as before i was using this product.  Plus it is made in the USA!!!  it is not very big as i share a queen bed with my husband, i was worried it would take up too much space, but it is slimmer than the pillow i was using previously.  the air flow band does not bother me and i don't even know it is there."
b'I tried 5 other pregnancy pillows & they were all too tubular, thin or flat for me.  I have lower back pain & the only relief is to have a large pillow between my knees so my legs are pretty far apart.  All the other pillows were just too small to create enough space.  With this one you can customize the size of the candy cane end with the air flow velcro thing.  I also needed a pillow that did not go under my head because I have a special chiroractic neck pillow that I use.  This is perfect & fits under my growing belly & I still have some room to "hug" the top if I wish.  If i don\'t then I can just slide it down further.  I keep another normal pillow behind my back & when I need to roll over I don\'t have to bring the whole pillow with me.  I just push the regular pillow under my belly & can still use the candy cane part between my legs from behind.  I\'m so happy I finally found one that works for me!'
b'You don\'t have to be expecting to order this product.  I am a side sleeper and recently had hip surgery.  This item allows me to sleep comfortably on my side without breaking the prescribed "hip precautions".  It is so soft, yet sturdy.  With this pillow, I get a great nights sleep every night!'
b'comfortable, perfect firmness.  My husband ordered me this when we found out I was pregnant.  I loved it right away.  I had used a memory foam pillow and am typically a side sleeper.  When I would get up in the morning, my husband would steal it and sleep on it for his last hour of sleep.  We got over the fact that it was advertised as a pregnancy product and ordered him his own.  We both love them!  He is a stomach sleeper.  They also are great for lounging in bed, reading, etc... the candy cane shape can give your arms support.  I wish they sold covers without the velcro strap, which neither of us use.'
b'This is my 1st pregnancy and I usually slept with a small pillow between my legs. My normal pillow no longer helped so I ordered this pregnancy pillow. Love this pillow!!! First night with it was a battle but after I got use to it the second night was amazing!! No more back and hip pain! The only thing that is difficult with it is rolling over and getting in/out of the bed to pee at 3am haha!'
b"I really love this pillow and now can't sleep without it. It gives the perfect support and allows me to use my own pillow for my head. Since I'm really particular on what I use for pillows, I opted to get this pillow vs the one that has the head pillow part and it was a good choice."
b"I don't know how I would have survived my pregnancy without this. I'm currently 37 wks pregnant and still sleeping quite well and I owe a lot of that credit to the Preggle. I originally purchased a larger pregnancy pillow that also served as a pillow for my head. For me that was too much. The Preggle is just right in that it supports back, tummy and gives support to my legs and I can still use my own head pillow. It's not exactly easy to switch from being on one side to the other with a huge belly, but the Preggle doesn't make it impossible. It's also not so huge that your husband is kicked out of bed. Highly recommend. Comfortable material."
b'This pillow is great.  I like to fall asleep on my stomach, but you\'re not supposed to do that when pregnant.  It really helps me stay comfortable when sleeping on my side.  It was important for me to be able to use my own pillow so the length is great and I\'m tall (5\'9").  I am very glad I bought this pillow, it is totally worth the money!'
b'This was exactly what I was looking for. I had purchased the Snuggie one and hated the fact that it had to wrap around my neck. I just wanted something for my hips and back. This allows me to use my own pillow!'
b'My Leachoo comfort pillow I bought because I have a bad back. I use my pillow on a nightly basis it is so comfortable since I am a side sleeper to use to put my leg on it relieves the pain in my back without that pillow I suffered many nights of pain. I would be lost without my pillow I am so glad I made the choice invited I have never been happier.'
b"My wife calls this the best present I gave her while she was pregnant (not sure if that's a reflection on this product, or my gift giving prowess).  It is the perfect shape for multiple sleeping positions, but it doesn't take up too much room in the bed.  We also purchased a pillow case for a body cover that rendered the strap useless, but I don't know that she would have used it much anyway and the pillow case kept it out of the way.  After our daughter was born, the preggle became a back support/baby rest for nursing, and a place to set our newborn in a reclining position before she became mobile.  Highly recommended for new fathers to be who take an interest in the comfort of their pregnant wives."
b'I bought this pillow for my husband.  He suffers from lower back pain.  He was throwing his leg on me at night, which made me suffer.  He made fun of the pillow.  I told him to try it or we would have to sleep in separate beds.  After trying it,  he thought that it helped.  This is a great product!'
b'I bought a couple of different pillows to help with my lower back pain but the Preggle is the one to fix it.  I use it to rest my top leg on when laying on my side so that my hips and back are kept aligned as I sleep.  I tend to sleep in the recovery position - bottom leg out straight and the top leg bent up.  It\'s quite large, I\'m 5\'4" but after a few nights with it I got the hang of how to flip from side to side without pulling off the covers or disturbing my partner.  It\'s quite versatile and comes with a demonstration card of all the different positions you can sleep in.  I also use it against my back when sitting up in bed, it\'s very comfortable.'
b"I LOVE this pillow!!  I got my daughter, who is pregnant, one and I got me one too.  It's great for sitting in bed reading, gaming, watching tv or sleeping.If you have back issues or just want to more support for your body in bed, this pillow is GREAT!!  I've only had it for 6 nights.  If it flattens or is otherwise sucky, I'll come back and edit."
b"During my second trimester I had difficulty falling and staying asleep as I was so uncomfortable. This pillow was a lifesaver. I can fall asleep better with it, and get comfortable enough to fall back asleep after a bathroom break or two....or three.The Velcro strap is annoying, but I rolled it up and tucked it into the top pouch. I didn't cut it off because i used it to roll the pillow up to make it fit in a bag on an overnight trip. There was no way I was going away with out it!I got lucky....looking at the reviews some women had to try a few pillows to get good results. This one was immediate. I didn't think I'd like it but can't imagine being without it."
b"My hubby got this for me when I was 20 weeks pregnant now I'm 36 weeks and have used it every single night! It is perfect for conforming to your new body/bump, and stays between my knees for great support. Plus it can be adjusted in different ways with the strap."

b'I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through every preggers pillow on the market, and this is by far my favorite because it has been the most effective. I\xe2\x80\x99m a back sleeper so I needed to train myself to sleep on my side.  The Hiccapop was the only other keeper, as the wedge has become a necessity to support my belly the bigger it gets. The Snoogle and other body pillows were way too hot and got in the way of my 16 nightly bathroom trips. None of them kept me on my side anyway. I could go through the list of all the others and why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, but all that matters is that this one is the best. It\xe2\x80\x99s multifunctional; it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect size; it\xe2\x80\x99s firm, yet soft and it actually stays cool. I was initially surprised by the filling..they\xe2\x80\x99re like beads almost, but I love it, as it makes it easy to \xe2\x80\x9cmold\xe2\x80\x9d into the shape you need it for at the time. Great for front or back support if you\xe2\x80\x99re laying on your side, behind the back or neck sitting up, and awesome in between your knees/legs. The pillow case fabric is super soft too. And I love that the case is removable and washable, but there is no annoying zipper you have to try to avoid. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little thing tucked in and you just have to hook a paper clip or something similar to pull it off and remove it. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to using this when baby is here too!Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier with this purchase and highly recommend to anyone looking for an amazingly comfortable and multi use pillow...before, during and after pregnancy.'
b'The best pregnancy thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve bought for sleeping!!!! I even returned my body pillow after finding this was much more functional. I struggled for weeks tossing and turning placing a pillow under my stomach. This solves all of that! I\xe2\x80\x99m currently 39 weeks and have had it for over a month. I tried to sleep without it one night and woke up in the middle in such bad pain!!! That\xe2\x80\x99s been the only night I\xe2\x80\x99ve *tried* to go without it. The padding on the sides is the perfect density and thickness. The belt part could be much better and made sturdier, as ive tried to move it a couple times and heard seams rip, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely comfortable and so far holding up well. It could also be a little smaller as it\xe2\x80\x99s quite large on me and I\xe2\x80\x99m in no way big, definitely average sized.'
b"I love this maternity pillow, makes sleeping so much better! I was debating between this pillow and a larger body pillow and decided for the Babymoov due to it's more compact size and I am so glad I did! It has just the right amount of support for my belly as I sleep on the side these days and it's rounded shape hugs the shape of my belly. I love it so much I now use it for everything: back rest while sitting, between my legs, and as a foot rest when I come home from work with swollen feet. I also like the soft fabric on both sides, and it has a cover that is washable."
b"I started using it at 6 months pregnant and it works wonders in getting a good night's sleep. The front of the belt has a very soft fabric with elastic at the top and bottom which feels nice and comfortably hugs your belly while the sides have foam pillows that gives you support while sleeping. You can adjust the belt at the back. I sleep on the side and it fills the gap between my waist and the bed really nicely and provide just the right amount of support throughout the night. I've been using regular pillows to get some support and I am so happy I discovered the  Babymoov belt.I find  it also to be a much better alternative to the big pregnancy pillows which take so much space in bed. I also purchased their travel pillow for foot or head support and love it as well."
b'I just purchased my third one of these.  The first I used throughout my pregnancy for sleep. This pillow was in the delivery room and then recovery and was so nice to have for all.  It went from pregnancy pillow to breastfeeding pillow overnight.  And now my 8 week old loves to lounge on it in my lap.  I HIGHLY recommend this pillow.  I get 10x more use out of this pillow over my boppy pillow.  Honestly wish I had another one of these instead of the boppy.  I now have three because my first one is pretty worn in at this point and not as supportive but still useable.  And I bought a 3rd one on a lightning deal.  I feel the more the better because the minute this pillow isn\xe2\x80\x99t available for purchase will be a sad day in my household.'
b'Item got here on time and was just as described!  It is WAY better than needing to put large, bulky pillow on both sides'
b"My wife started using it at around 7 months in, and it has saved her so many hours of sleep. She went through the pillows and didn't do much, but this one works, especially since it is worn on herself, unlike the pillows that shifted. The material is very soft, washable, and not bulky. She highly recommends it."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 31 weeks and this thing is amazing! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it 2 nights and have noticed a big difference! While I sleep with a huge u body pillow, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the right support on my sides without a lot of repositioning (this is just in the last couple weeks as my belly has grown). This belt is amazing because it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially 2 pillows strapped to me, so I can roll around all I want and not have to wake myself to reposition pillows. I love it! Hoping the pillows don\xe2\x80\x99t flatten over the next weeks though!'
b'Love this thing. My back hurt so much before while I slept with a pillow under my belly. This makes it so much more comfortable. Totally worth the purchase.'
b'I love this belt. Has helped immensely with my back pain while I sleep, is adjustable for a wide variety of sizes, & super comfortable. Between this & my pregnancy pillow, I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a small bubble.'
b'This thing is a life saver!! Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep without it! Helps so much with round ligament pains and overall back pains. Within about 30 min of not wearing it I immediately realize why I\xe2\x80\x99m uncomfortable! I have two body pillows and a leg pillow. This thing is my favorite. Then the leg pillow. The Body pillows felt amazing, but eventually started to hurt my neck. Not sure why.'
b'So, yesterday I received my belly pillow & here is my personal review:I used the pillow as a lounge around at first and it did help with pressure (on the sides) when sitting & I used it last night while sleeping and it actually made a difference. Of course being pregnant \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb0\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbe you\xe2\x80\x99re going to toss and turn and have to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, but while sleeping on my sides I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any pressure or cramps I was very comfortable. My only \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d comment about it is the Sam as the other ladies, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit big currently (I am 29wks & due December 2018) but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure as I get further along, it will start to fit just a bit better. Other than that I give it 4.5 \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f rating and would recommend it to any of my pregnant friends! \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b"This product is incredible. I use it in my office, in my bed, everywhere I go. Supplies great support while also being incredibly comfortable. I'm sure it works great for pregnant women and babies too!"
b"I am 32 weeks along and I have been using this for about 5 days now and I've already noticed a difference in my comfort level when I sleep.  I have a bad back and the last  couple of weeks I had very little sleep due to back pain and the inability to get comfortable.  I had used multiple pillows to try and get comfortable but they were either big and bulky or didn't provide enough support.  This belt has memory foam cushions that support the belly and my back when I'm  sleeping on either side and stays in place all night long. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81"
b"Love this pillow! I am pregnant & bought this to use as a support for my belly & arm to rest on while sleeping. It has great support! I am looking forward to using with baby after he's born. I think it'll make a great nursing pillow as well. I highly recommend this even though it is a bit pricey."
b'This is probably my favorite pregnancy purchase! We have a queen size bed and a huge body pillow just isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option.  This little guy has become my best friend- and will stay that way after the baby comes.  I use it to prop up my back, between my legs, for belly support, and sometimes I just hug it at night and it keeps me up on my side (and snuggles me when my husband own\xe2\x80\x99t!).  It\xe2\x80\x99s soft yet when pressure is applied, it keeps its firmness instead of getting squished which is ideal.  My hubby even steals it when I get up in the morning and when he kicks me in his sleep it acts as a shield, what does this thing not do?!  Just the best purchase ever!'
b'This pillow has made sleep much more comfortable. Side cushions helped alleviate much of the rib pain I was experiencing at night while sleeping on my side. I also feel like my growing belly is well-supported using this belt. Bought this belt while 36-weeks pregnant. Regret not purchasing it sooner!'
b'Perfect for people with neck problems.'
b'Love \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f this pillow it Great \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbe for my legs and back doing pregnancy. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste money on the cover though.'
b"The pregnancy pillow it's comfortable. My wife is 5 months pregnant and helps her sleep very well."

b"Hello, I'm back with this Leachco upgrade.  I originally had what I am considering the first edition\xc2\xa0Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory\xc2\xa0of this Back 'N Belly pillow, due to unfortunate circumstances of moving in with a guy, only having a queen bed, blah blah, relationship, my original pillow ended up getting thrown out.  I can't believe I did that either.  I'm terrible.  Luckily I'm single again and have my queen bed all to myself, and with the size of this pillow, you need it.First, it arrived in a the biggest box I've ever seen Amazon ship to me.  There was no shrink wrapping or anything for this pillow, so it was its full massive size when it arrived.  It came with a large printout of the pillow positions, which was pretty cool.  Also, it talks about the difference of zipper up/zipper down, which zipper up provides more support in the middle U part of the pillow, zipper down is more for sleeping.Second, the pillowcase is much softer than the other Leachco pillow, and SO MUCH EASIER to remove. An incredible difference!!  I took off the cover and washed it on cold, then tumble dried low, as the instructions said.  I timed myself putting it back on, 3 minutes.  That time could have something to do with a cat that likes to swipe at my laundry, but it is so much easier to take on/off.The pillow construction itself is a lot better.  So, one of the bigger problems with the other model was the seam.  It was 2D construction, in that it was 2 seams total, one on the outside, one on the inside.  This pillow is like 3D construction and has multiple seams (like V Seams, see photo) to support the curvature of the pillow, moving the pillow how you want is super easy, and also, no seam that digs into your neck or shoulder!  The stuffing of the pillow is full and soft, it reminds me of the Beautyrest Black Label or Black Diamond pillows from Costco, just a really soft and fluffy marshmallow nest.I still don't have kids, but I still have hip and lower back pain, and this pillow is helping me already.  My cat loves to sleep on the sides of it with me as well.  If you are thinking about a Leachco, I would highly recommend spending the additional dollars to get this one.  The seam issue alone is worth the upgrade.  It takes a couple nights to get used to sleeping with Phillow again, but now that we are back together, nothing can tear us apart.  For couples, you can have it in an L shape if you need to, it's flexible!"
b'I love my pillow! I tried the snoogle first per a friend suggestion and found the inner seam cutting into my neck. As I continued to search I found a lot of The pillows reviews complained of the seam... The bliss is made without the inner seam for Ultimate comfort. Since getting the pillow I have had a much better night sleep. And little back pain. I highly recommend the Bliss over any of the others.'
b"Trying to decide if you need to get this for your pregnant wife/GF/partner/whatever? HELL YES! This has been the best purchase I have made so far during my wife's pregnancy (and I've made a few). I surprised her with this monster of a pillow at the end of her 2nd trimester and I'm quite sure I could ignore her for the rest of this pregnancy and she would still love me. I will warn you, unless you have a king sized bed you are about to lose the majority of your already diminishing sleep space. She sleeps like a rock now and her hip pain is pretty much gone. If this pillow was a man she would leave me for it. I'm cool with it. It makes her completely happy and she sleeps much better which means that I am happy and I sleep better too."
b"This pillow allows you to sleep in multiple positions comfortably. I'm not pregnant but recently had a mommy makeover and this made having to sleep on my back bearable. It is quite large, so if you have anything smaller than a king size bed or sleeping with a partner..this might not work for you. Great pillow though!"
b"Not pregnant and never had a baby before, but I use this thing nightly to help with back and shoulder pain.  I now can't sleep without it.  I even packed this sucker in a Space Bag to take it on a trip overseas.  Worked like a charm.  This is my wubby!"
b'Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be sleeping in the same bed as my partner anytime soon because between me and the pillow there\xe2\x80\x99s no extra room! However, this pillow is great and the sateen cover makes for extra comfort if you\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping on your side. Phenomenal for my back!'
b'The Back and Belly Bliss was a gift to for my daughter in law. She told me it was the best gift she received. Great for back and tummy support. She has been sleeping with it since Jan.Our granddaughter will be born in July. A lot of restful nights.'
b'Very good quality/ I was worried about it if its gonna be firm enough, its perfect for me. I am 5 feet 10 so i got the 65" one. love this!!!'
b'Helped with back pain immediately. You can feel the back ache go away as soon as you tuck it under your back.  The only down side is everyone loves it so I have to keep stealing corners of it back from our Labrador and my husband all night long.'
b'Has really helped stay on my side my entire pregnancy, it is huge, but it is worth it.'
b'Pillow is huge.  Takes up more then half the queen size bed but my wife is happy'
b'Had one of these during pregnancy and it was amazing! Unfortunately got rid of it after and purchased for comfort post tummy tuck. The first one I had was super long like down to my feet. I do prefer that over the shorter one but didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it as an option anymore.'
b"As other reviews mentiomed, this thing is huge but I love it. I have shoulder pain so sleeping on my side is really difficult but you have to at a certain point in pregnancy. This thing worked well and for once I didn't wake up uncomfortable 10 times during the night. It helps to wrap the sheets around it and put the back side between your legs, then it doesn't splay as wide. My husband was okay with it but it does take up a pretty large portion of our queen bed. He laughed at me in my nest but hey, at least I got some good sleep finally!"
b"This pillow allows you to sleep in multiple positions comfortably. I'm not pregnant but recently had a mommy makeover and this made having to sleep on my back bearable. It is quite large, so if you have anything smaller than a king size bed or sleeping with a partner..this might not work for you. Great pillow though!"

b'When I ordered this, I was really afraid that this pillow was cheaper than the name brand ones for a reason.  However, I really didn\'t want to spend more so I trusted the positive reviews.  I am SO GLAD!!  First of all, there are mixed reviews about the length.  I am 5\'7" and with my head on the top of the pillow and shoulder up against the inside top, the pillow ends right below my knees (if my legs are straight).  Usually I bend my knees and even more of my legs are on it. It does sometimes bother me that my ankles rub together, but I don\'t think many body pillows are long enough to prevent that. The first picture I\'m posting is the compressed pillow removed from the box but still in plastic.  The next picture is right after opening it. It fluffs up pretty well on its own, but I did throw it in the dryer (no heat) with dryer balls for a few minutes to even it out. The third picture is my 3 ft tall 2 year old and my previous pillow for size comparison.  It is well stuffed and is very supportive when you lay on it. The cover is fairly easy to remove, wash, and replace. I love that I can sleep on one side, then turn to the other side without dragging my pillow with me like I had to with my straight body pillow.  I have a King bed so it doesn\'t bother my husband, but it is pretty large so I\'m not sure if it would get in the way of the other person on a queen bed. The only reservation I have is that I\'m not sure I will be able to rest my third trimester belly on top of it during my next pregnancy since it is so stuffed.  I may just use a little wedge and just enjoy the benefits of the support it gives to my back and legs instead.'
b"This pillow is worth every cent! I'm currently 18 weeks pregnant and toss and turn all night. I've only had this pillow for three nights, but since I've had it I'm finally sleeping. I'm also a back sleeper, which is dangerous for my baby, so I love that this pillow keeps me on my side. Other reviews said their pillow arrived flat or with the stuffing unevenly distributed, but that was not the case with the item I received. I'm 5 5 and this pillow is a perfect fit for me."
b'I didn\'t like it at first because it made me hot in the late summer time but once I hit winter for my 6-9months I loved it.  I ended up flipping the pillow around so the "Head" supported my feet and ankles.  The "Head" pillow was not enough sex support for me that is why I tried it flipped around!! The fact it had to sides was amazing bc i tend to move right to left all thought the night. A must if your planing on getting any sleep while pregnant!!!'
b"This was a great purchase that I've been using for almost my entire pregnancy. The cover comes off and is machine washable. Its a fraction of the cost of pillows you can get in stores. Unlike other reviews, I didn't have any issues with the consistency of the pillow. It came to me soft and fluffy right out of the box. Although I am looking forward to sleeping on my back again once the baby gets here, this has definitely been a good purchase and I think I will continue to use it for breastfeeding support."
b"I couldn't bring myself to spend a fortune on a maternity pillow, so I took a chance on this one.  I've been using is for about 8 weeks now and I wouldn't be surviving pregnancy without it.  I am a back sleeper, but this pillow keeps me comfortable on my side all night. It is not overstuffed, but is a good balance of soft fluffiness and support.  No regrets about saving money with this pillow!"
b"Must have when pregnant! I sleep really well with this and it doesn't overwhelm our bed too bad (queen size). My husband sometimes uses the one side. The only thing when I make the bed it looks like two bodies sleeping! When vistors come over they get confused ha-ha. But have had for a few months and am in the start of my third trimester and really enjoy."
b"I love this pillow I've been using it for about a month and it is awesome! It came really quick with standard shipping and I love it. It has made my nights soooo much better now I'm 27 weeks and it is awesome still. It's just enough firm and soft that it really helps me feel comfortable at night while my baby kicks away. Its a good support for the neck too so you don't wake up feeling sore. Helps me feel refreshed and well rested. I would recommend to anyone. Good for the price."
b'I love this pillow! My husband is a bit jealous because all i want to snuggle with is my pillow now lol. Its full, not flimsy, very comfy and puffy. I thought it was going to be flat but its perfect. My back feels better and my belly has the support now. And guess who i found sleeping with my pillow the other day...my husband. This pillow is a great buy.'
b"It was hard to get used to at first, simply because my husband and I don't have a big bed to begin with. But I absolutely love it, it is first but not hard and I feel like I get great head and neck support. The curve in the top does not bother me like it was mentioned by some others. I am so so happy I have my maternity pillow!"
b'The perfect pillow for my very pregnant daughter who came to visit over the holidays.  She complained that she spent way more than I did for the same pillow in a color she did not like.  Of course...this one stays at my house for her visits!  Excellent pillow....it really did the job for my daughter.'
b'Im not prego and never plan to be... Im a side sleeper and I rotate sides at night so this helps keep my spine aligned properly by placing my leg up on it. It does a wonderful job and Im very pleased. Its very very large though. It almost takes up my entire full sized bed.'
b"I really love this pillow. I bought it when I was just a couple of months pregnant because my back started aching every night and I've had it for almost four months now. I never complain to my husband about my back hurting anymore so he LOVES that he doesn't have to massage me every night now haha it's a really good pillow for me. I didn't want an overly stuffed pillow. It has more stuffing in the head area than the leg areas, but my knees are kept apart enough that it's very comfortable. I've had it for a while now and it hasn't lost any of its fluff where my knees rest. Every morning when I wake up to have breakfast, when I come back in the room to lay down my husband has always commandeered this pillow and wont give it back. He wants one of his own! It's a really big comfy pillow but it's not too big. We have a king size bed but it doesn't even take up my half of the bed and it keepse put at night so my husband is loving having extra space for himself. I really like this pillow!"
b'This pillow is a monster and saved me through my pregnancy. I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging onto it for the second time around!'
b"Awesome pillow! I love being able to shift from side to side without having to flip the pillow around me. Warning: This is a really big pillow. It might be an issue if your bed is small and/or you sleep with someone else. I have a king-size bed and it's fine."
b'I sleep so well with this pillow! My only complaint is that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough stuffing throughout the pillow.'
b"I am 25 weeks pregnant, I really debated for a weeks whether it would be worth it to purchase this type of pillow.  I received my pillow 1 week ago and let me tell you I LOVEEEE it!! It's so cozy and comfy. I sleep so much more comfortable as I am a former belly sleeper now I can sleep on my side with the support of this pillow. I feel so much more rested in the mornings. I highly recommend this for all pregnant ladies!! You will not regret this purchase."
b'What a difference a good pillow makes! This is the ONLY pregnancy pillow I could find that gives back support. head support, belly support, and the all important inbetween legs pillow..... LOVE THIS PILLOW!!!!!'
b'I LOVE THIS PREGNANCY PILLOW!!!! Oh my gosh, it has changed my life. I look forward to snuggling into it every night to sleep. I am 25 weeks pregnant and it has made sleeping so much more comfortable. I didnt really think a pregnancy pillow would make that much of a difference in getting a good night sleep, but I am so glad I gave this pillow a chance. It is soft and comfy, but not too soft! I have now been using it for about a month and it has not lost its shape at all. I am actually already dreading having to give it up when the baby comes! It is rather big, but it fits in our queen bed, my husband just has to deal with it :) He knows how happy it makes me. You will not be disappointed with this pillow!!!'
b"got it for my daughter she loves it!! Said it's the only way she can get sleep and she will sleep with it after the baby is born."
b'Absolutely a must have!! Especially if you are use to sleeping on your stomach this gives you the support you need to get to sleep quickly and soundly. The back support that it gives is amazing as well. Another added plus, is the fact that it is on both sides so even your partner can take advantage of the pillow!!'

b'I love this thing.  I am 22 weeks pregnant and despite my belly hasn\'t grown too much, sleeping is so uncomfortable!  I am normally a back sleeper, but while pregnant you are supposed to sleep on your side.  This helps me SOOO much to be comfortable.  I actually don\'t use my pillow, but use the curved section under my neck like a pillow, and "spoon" the rest of the pillow with one leg over it.  It is super comfortable and I\'ve been sleeping so much better.  I should note I have constant lower back issues, but this pillow doesn\'t affect that.  I wake up feeling fine,Anyway, this thing is so comfortable that my husband was jealous he didn\'t have one and I ordered one for him too!  We both are currently using snoogles.  Ha ha.  Overall a great purchase and worth the price tag.'
b"I'm a back sleeper so sleeping on my side was very uncomfortable during the first half of my pregnancy. I thought I could get away with using a bunch of pillows to support my back/hips/belly/neck, etc, but no matter what pillows I tried of various thicknesses, I still woke up everyday with aches and pains. Finally I caved and ordered the Snoogle and my only regret is not ordering it from the beginning!! I cannot believe what a difference it makes. It provides the perfect support everywhere a pregnant body needs it. It is well worth the money. It is big, but not too big. I thought my husband would hate it because it took up too much space in our queen bed, but he actually loved it! When he's cuddle me he had a nice soft pillow to cuddle too ;) I even packed this into a huge duffel bag when I traveled and took it everywhere with me because I can't sleep without it. Definitely order the one with the cotton jersey pillowcase because it's cheaper than ordering it separately. Every pregnant woman needs this!"
b'I\'m absolutely IN LOVE with this pillow. Let me tell you something right off - buy one with a cover!! I actually ordered a replacement cover (in a darker color) so I can change them often. I suffer from horrid reflux at night due to having a LapBand, and this contraption (along with an angled "ramp" pillow have completed solved the problem. I\'m only 40 mind you, but man - this just makes my body feel better. I\'m a stomach sleeper - an absolute no-no for reflux folks, but with this pillow, I can lie on my left side and kind of lean into the pillow and since I\'m elevated, the reflux doesn\'t occur. So comfy. Also I have a bad knee and this has been perfect for that as well. I want to buy one of these for the living room too. It\'s amazingly comfy on the couch - props you in a perfect position, makes it easier to read, etc. LOVE LOVE LOVE!'
b"I never thought I would buy a pregnancy pillow because it felt like a waste of money, but when I could barely sleep or wake up without aches and pains I broke down and bought one.  What was I waiting for?!?  This pillow is a lifesaver. BONUS: My husband and doggie both love it too :-)After reading several other reviews I chose this particular Snoogle because it came with a removable pillow case with a zipper.  I've washed and dryer the case in the dryer and it was a breeze to put back on.Don't settle for less.  This one is a winner!"
b"Bought this for my wife early on in her pregnancy. She had been having trouble getting comfortable and sleeping. This was money well spent! She's happy. She's comfortable. And she gets to sleep, which is good for everyone! Granted it's like having 3 people in the bed sometimes, but as long as she's happy and comfortable, I'll tolerate it!"
b'I know this pillow is a bit pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it.  I bought it pretty early on in my pregnancy and as I\'ve grown, so has my love for the pillow.  I paid more for the version that comes with its own removable cover and I\'m glad I did as it makes cleaning simple.The only negative is that it did "shed" on my sheets when I first used it.  It left little white pills of material stuck to my maroon sheets.  Oh and beware if you have dogs or cats as they will also surely love it.  Mine are obsessed with it and I often have to relocate an animal or two at bedtime so I can use it :-)'
b'100% worth it. I was unable to sleep on my side before I got this pillow.  I have always been a back sleeper and always will be, but during my pregnancy, obviously that has to change! This pillow has made it comfortable to fall asleep on my side and helps provide support where we need it.'
b"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and I think it was her favorite gift! I tried it a few times when she wasn't around and I even want one!"
b'I am a back sleeper and as soon as I became too pregnant to sleep on my back, I literally could not sleep without this at night! I love my snoogle and recommend it to EVERY friend who asks!'
b"Love, love, love! Best thing ever! Wish I'd had this with my first pregnancy. Been using this every night since my husband gifted it to me, love it!"
b'So glad that I ordered this as soon as sleeping became a bit more challenging.  I find the support for my head, back, and knees perfect right now and as my belly grows I expect it will be a great support when I flip it around.'
b"Love this pillow! It has been an absolute God send, I can't imagine being pregnant without this product! The material is very good quality, and it is versatile in the way, you can use it. #happymama"
b'Loved it while pregnant and still use it after delivering.'
b'This was a gift for my boyfriends daughter who is having a baby in Jan. This body pillow is exactly how it is described and she just slept with it last night for the first time and she absolutely LOVES IT! She said she slept better and she was very comfortable. I did ask if she was to hot from it being Jersey Cotton and she said no, it actually kept her body temp neutral. She is also excited that she can use this to help breast feed comfortably.'
b'This arrived at the same time as the pizza I ordered, securing my place as the best husband ever.'
b'I love this thing!'
b'Present for Wife and Daughter.  Each said one word.  Wonderful!'
b"This makes being pregnant much easier! It's super comfortable, and it keeps me nice and warm! I love this pillow!"
b'This is exactly what I needed to sleep again during this pregnancy. No other "pillows" seemed to be comfortable. I will recommend this product to every pregnant friend I know.'
b"I wish I had this pillow when I was pregnant with my twins.  I wish I had it now!!  Great idea for those that can't get comfortable and use multiple pillows.  I use one for my head, one to hug and one to put between my knees.  This would be perfect!!"

b"Started off on the fence, but now my wife loves it.I bought this pillow for my pregnant wife (who is very picky by the way), and at first she liked the way it cradled her, but complained about not being able to use her regular pillow in conjunction with this.  However, fast forward about a month and she has ditched her $100 deluxe-memory foam pillow and uses this exclusively.Pros:Very comfortable and my wife enjoys using it in different ways.  I will often find her sitting in it on her phone, kind of like a plushy inner tube, then at night she will sleep on her side and this kind of cradles her.Cons:The only complaints that I have heard from my wife at all, was that compared to the gel-cooling pillow she was using, this one tends to be a bit warmer, not a deal breaker in the winter though.This complaint is actually more from me (the husband) than anything, but this thing is huge.  We used to have a queen-sized bed, which was already a little small, then she brought this home, and my half of the bed turned into a third.  We have since upgraded to a king-sized mattress (she bought it because she felt bad for me), and now that isn't a problem, but buyer beware.Conclusion:The only thing that really matters here is comfort, and this thing provides that for my wife.  Occasionally before this pillow, I would wake up and find my wife sleeping on the couch or another bed because she couldn't get comfortable.  That hasn't happened once since we got this.  Sure, you husbands will have to share a bed with now effectively two other people, but as long as the wife is comfortable right?  By the way, I tried laying with it once and it is very comfortable, but don't tell my wife."
b"Oh Snoogle, how I long to lay with you and drift off to a comfortable slumber....I love this pillow! I am currently 9 weeks pregnant and have been suffering from leg cramps (which I have suffered with prior to pregnancy as well). This is my second pregnancy and did not use a pregnancy pillow for the first, which was a mistake. I shopped pregnancy pillows for a couple weeks before deciding on this one. It cake down to 4...the Snoogle, Leachco Grow to Sleep, Coolmax PP, and the Lotus Leaf Pregnancy Sleep System (which was quickly ruled out once I got a grip and realized paying $200 for a pillow was ridiculous considering my grandmother bared 9 children with no fancy fluffiness). I chose this one based on reviews and size. The U shaped just seemed too big even though we have a King bed but after you throw a 220lb hubby and 2 year old in the mix, it just didn't seem sensible. So, I ended up with the Snoogle. Love it!!pros:The jersey cover is soft and breathable, easy to remove and clean.Oh so comfortable and easy to maneuver for max comfort.Right amount of supportPromotes side sleeping but still comfortable if you end up on your back.Con:Wish there was just a little more fluff where my knees land.Makes it hard to get out of bed...cause I am too comfortable!"
b"This pillow is the only thing that helps me sleep on my side during pregnancy, and I only wish I had gotten it sooner. It's so comfortable to snuggle up with and provides full body support. My arm never falls asleep even if I tuck one underneath. I also find that if I want to switch sides during the night, there are enough comfortable configurations that you don't necessarily need to flip the whole pillow over. It is quite large, so it makes a bit of a tight squeeze in a queen sized bed with my husband, but still very manageable. My only real complaint is that the fabric has pilled where it is used most often, which is a bit of an irritant."
b'I have two boys, so this pregnancy isn\'t my "first rodeo". With the previous pregnancies, I remember awful back pain and hip pain from having to sleep on my side. Not so with this one!Because of this pillow, I can comfortably sleep on my side. My husband doesn\'t complain much (though I have awakened to see him sleeping in the guest room because I took up too much of the bed. Ha ha). Right now at 17 weeks, my favorite position is to have the curve of the pillow at my back, the top curved around my shoulder supporting my neck, and the bottom through my knees keeping them at a comfortable distance. I feel like I\'m being hugged all night long, and it doesn\'t raise my skin temperature to uncomfortable OVEN temperatures like snuggling with my husband does. I let him borrow it one night because of his back pain, and he said he didn\'t want to stop snuggling with it either.'
b"LOVE. I am 16 weeks pregnant and have been using it nightly for about the past month and a half. It's been so great already, I am excited to see how helpful it is as my pregnancy progresses! The cover is very easy to remove, wash, and replace. The fabric is soft and fortunately, doesn't collect hair from our dogs or fuzz. We loved it so much that we purchased a second one for our almost 3-year old daughter's bed. It is the perfect guard for keeping her in bed!!! No more rolling out! Now my husband is begging for his own HAHA! Highly recommend for pregnant women, children that role out of bed, or the general pillow lover! Highly, highly recommend."
b"I am updating this review after using the Snoogle through my whole pregnancy and for at least one month postpartum.  If you are a back or front sleeper, do not hesitate to buy this!  It is worth every penny! I bought it when I was 5 weeks along, but it improved my sleep dramatically the first night, and continued to be crucial for a good night's sleep through the end of pregnancy.  I hauled it along on a cross-country trip when I was 6 months pregnant because I couldn't imagine sleeping without it.  I hauled it to the hospital for labor.  It served as a breastfeeding pillow for the first few weeks.  I still needed it for sleep for a few weeks after birth as well, as my body adjusted.  It was absolutely the best pregnancy support item I purchased for myself, bar none.I am not a natural side sleeper, but pregnancy requires you to sleep on your side, especially as your belly grows. This pillow supports you so that you can kind of sleep tilted towards your back or front, taking some pressure off your knee and hip.  Sure, you can get support from a pile of pillows, but with the number of nighttime bathroom breaks you'll take in your third trimester, you want to be able to adjust yourself back in bed to fall asleep again in a hurry.  I could just slip back into bed, moving the pillow swiftly around my head and under my leg, and I was asleep again in no time.  The pillow is big, but curled around me it didn't really affect my husband's sleep in our queen-sized bed (though he was happy to see it finally leave the bed when our son was a month old).Is it hot?  Well, I was sleeping hot, but it wasn't because of this pillow.  I was huge and due in August.  I sweated on this pillow nightly, and it needed to be washed on a fairly regular basis.  The jersey cover stood up to weekly washings pretty well.  I wouldn't consider this a long-term pillow option, but pregnancy is a pretty difficult time.  Sleep is precious.  You need it and your baby needs you to get it, and this pillow is why I was sleeping well at all.I did not need an additional head pillow with this because I felt that it supported my neck really well.  In fact, I usually have issues with my neck and often get stiff necks, but this was the perfect support and I didn't get a stiff neck any day that I used it."
b"Wouldn't have been able to make it through my pregnancy without this pillow. Some reviews have said that this is pricey. However, I purchased this pillow within the first 12 weeks of my pregnancy and use it every single night. It is definitely worth every penny! The cover zips off so you can wash it and the fit around your body is great!I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this pillow if you are expecting. I even take it with me on road trips to use in a hotel bed as well."
b'So I LOVE THIS pillow and loved it\'s price. I have affectionately named my pillow "Mr. Bean" and it has replaced my hubby as my snuggle partner! Needless to say, he is pretty jealous, but WHO cares! He is not the one pregnant with twins, and as many pregnant moms to be know, snuggling next to your partner is NOT the same while preggo...we are so badly in need of proper support and body alignment and men usually run so HOT while they sleep. Our hormones are rushing,( and we can get crazy hot flashes) he is generating too much heat, and my lower back kills! Not a happy mama! Enter Mr. Bean...So I researched and researched all maternity pillow reviews on Amazon. Alas, at the end of the day, pretty much even the most gloriously reviewed products have a few one stars in there, so you HAVE to take a leap of faith. Fact was, this pillow has consistently great reviews for a reason. Its a great pillow. (Plus, after a few hours on Amazon getting bleary eyed from reading review after review after review for ANY item relating to pregnancy or babies...would be moms KNOW what I mean- it was time to just make a choice. I\'m so glad I settled on this one.)I have been sleeping on this little gem for 3 weeks straight....here is my assessment...I like that the cover is soft cotton jersey and is removeable and washable, although I havent attempted to remove and wash it yet, and before you go EEEWWW..here\'s why....I followed a tip from another Amazon reviewer who uses a soft cotten jersey pillow case and slips it right over the part where you head rests, and you remove and wash THIS piece weekly, and the outer cover twice or so a month...any way, I digress...the pillow is a good length, and the seam of the pillow that some reviewers were complaining about on cheaper versions of Snoogles that dug into their neck and shoulders while they tried to sleep doesnt happen here. And while its not a fully wrap around maternity pillow like some of those on sale here for 100 bucks or so (which prevents the user from having to flip it over to the other side if you want to change sleep sides during the night) to me, 18 weeks pregnant with twins, and already holding and showing as someone pregnant with one baby would look at 26 weeks or so, this doesnt matter to me, since I get up several times during the night to use the bathroom anyway. I just flip it over when I go back to bed.It is super soft, yet supportive, and I am super picky about the neck support I receive from my pillows while I sleep. I usually use my organic latex support pillow even on top of the head part of this pillow to support my head and neck while I sleep (and to keep my body at a slight incline to help with the dreaded acid reflux) but even if I didn\'t I would still be ok. It provides enough head and neck support all by itself.This pillow also cradles your back yet gives it soft support, and put between your knees also helps with proper spinal alignment. In sum, it helps pregnant mamas in desperate need of proper nighttime support to sleep peacefully and comfortably! It solves all the problems of having to struggle with 4 or 5 regular pillows in order to get comfortable. I also plan to snuggle with Mr Bean even after the babies are born...unless the Hubby decides to hide him from me! I love this thing. Get it, and love it too!'
b"So I'm 16 weeks pregnant & this pillow is like my new best friend. I've had it for about 2 weeks now & used it every night. I got it because my pregnancy was causing a lot of back & hip pain, I was losing soooo much very needed sleep & was starting to hoard pillows, even my husbands. This pillow hs been a life saver, I was a little nervous about the price of it but so far it's completely worth the money. I sleep with it every night (it took a couple nights to find that perfect position for me), I use it when just relaxing on the couch or to prop myself up. some people said they had problems with it wrapping over their shoulder & they didn't like using it as pillow for their heads but I actually really like that part. With another small pillow under it my shoulders aren't uncomfortably crunched together. The size isn't too bad either. My husband & I have a queen size bed & we can easily fit with the pillow & have no problems. Now to figure out how to get it into my suitcase to take home on vaca in a few weeks..."
b"My first Snoogle was ruined during my delivery at the hospital. It broke my heart to throw it away. It was like throwing away an old friend. Now that I'm pregnant with #2, I knew it was Snoogle time. My husband hates it because it's an awkward barrier between us but my hips and tailbone are grateful so he can stuff it."
b"I love the snooggle, this is my second one from amazon... my dog loves it too so i gave her my old one. I'm not pregnant, but i am a side sleeper with back issues and neck problems and this helps tremendously. Its the only cuddle buddy you'll ever need. after my first one almost all of my friends went out and got one, to the point where one of my friends made us all snoogle covers for christmas last year. seriously amazing. warning, if you are in a relationship, they will hate it (because you will probably choose this over them) or they'll want their own."
b'This has saved my sleep since the end of the first trimester, when it started to be uncomfortable to sleep any way but on my side. It is dense enough to retain its shape, offers great support in a variety of configurations, and the cotton cover is soft and cozy.  You can even curl it up like a pretzel, and use it to prop yourself up enough to sleep on your back, if you need a break from side sleeping. I miss it when we go on trips, and do not sleep nearly as well without it.'
b"Simply Amazing! I haven't slept well in weeks! I'm 19 weeks pregnant and I'm up at least 6 times a night. I had to go to a different bed in the middle of the night just to get comfortable... until now!! I used the Snoogle for first night last night. I slept well and didn't leave my bed! It fits my body great! Easy to wash cover. I would recommend this to any pregnant woman! $60 well spent!"
b"I agree the top seam is tight if I push right up on it, but I'm short enough in the torso and long enough in the next that it doesn't really bother me personally.  I find myself really sleeping easier with it, I was waking up constantly, readjusting pillows, etc.  It takes up a lot of room in the bed yes, but I keep it with the long closed side towards the outside of the bed all the time - Hubby works around it to still support my back and cuddle in as we fall asleep, then if I roll at night it supports my back, so it's a win win for us.  Plus, with all the other configurations you can use it for, I think in the long run we will absolutely get our money back out of it."
b"There are not enough wonderful things to say about this pillow. I use it for sleeping it helps my belly and hips not be so sore in the AM. I use for lounging and elevating my feet as well. It's super soft and the cover is removable for washing. I am sure i will be using this long after my pregnancy as well."
b'This has absolutely helped my sleep during the second trimester. I had some serious hip pain and this pillow helps to alleviate a lot of that. I also like that there are different ways to use it depending on your sleep position.'
b'Amazing body pillow, I find it to be a little too stuffed for my liking so I use a smaller feather pillow (my DH calls is my "squish" pillow) for my head so my neck isn\'t too high up. I\'m 5\'4" and this pillow is awesome. Just about into my third trimester and I recommend this to all pregnant ladies! I am a total back sleeper though, and having this gives me something to lean on/stop me from being completely on my back at night so that is a plus too!'
b'I love this product! I purchased it early in my pregnancy, before my belly grew large and sleeping was *actually* uncomfortable. I like that I can use it on both sides and in multiple ways. My husband even likes it so much that he "borrows" it for naptimes.I thought it was a little pricy, but now that I\'ve experienced good sleep with it, it\'s definitely a product I will and do recommend to expecting moms. (and really, all side sleepers)'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m about 20 weeks pregnant and tossed and turned at night...not to mention lots of snoring. This pillow helped a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and very curvy and find this works for me. Any taller and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it would work because it would be hard to keep between your knees because of the curve. I feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s probably perfection for ladies a little bit smaller than me but overall I\xe2\x80\x99m happy. I was pleasantly surprised by all the different positions you can use! see photo'
b"The Snoogle changed my life. I would have never made it through my pregnancy without it!!!! Buy this for yourself immediately. Buy it for your spouse and your pregnant friend. My husband even steals it sometimes it's so comfy."

b'Just ordered the 2nd pillow... for me (first was for my pregnant wife)... great pillow, arrived in a great carry-case that I did not even realize was included, and the pillow itself in a highly vacuumed sealed heavy-duty bag... just about only time I can remember being OK with throwing something onto my bed and laying face-first on without even washing first... (probably should have, but regardless).IMPORTANT!!!!! - At my height, around 5\'9"-5\'10", I think I am at the ABSOLUTE max (maybe half an inch more than max...) of height for this pillow... if the distance between my crotch and neckline were ANY longer, I might not like this pillow at all... just a word of warning for the longer-torso folks out there...Great product.'
b"I have used this product for almost my entire pregnancy. It has been an amazing investment and sometimes the only way I could get comfortable enough to sleep or even watch tv towards the end of my pregnancy due to severe pelvic pain. The only trouble I had was getting used to the top pillow portion instead of a regular pillow, tended to give me neck pains. Other than that, I don't think I would have gotten through without it! Plan on using it for nursing and hopefully any future pregnancies."
b'My husband has hip problems and likes how he can manipulate the pillow to work with him so he can sleep comfortably.  My kids want one too since it is very comfortable.'
b'It has made sleeping while pregnant so much easier. It\'s great for side sleeping and I occasionally want to sleep on my belly so I can "coil" it and make a donut hole and sleep face down. Also my husband kept trying to steal it from me so I ordered him his own. I will say though they aren\'t the most appealing pillow when you make your bed but that doesn\'t matter if it helps you sleep.'
b'The quality is there and came in time for Christmas.  I bought for my boyfriend and his bad back. Definitely recommend this product'
b'The best $40 I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent all year! I love this pillow and it goes everywhere I stay overnight. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found a better pillow for the rest of this pregnancy!'
b'Given to my Daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it along with her 3 year old. LOL'
b'Super Comfortable, love my pillow, it help sleep through the night. It is a big help for me and my back. I am happy that I got it.'
b'I have slept great every night since receiving this. Thanks!'
b'love it.'

b'This was loaned to me due to the fact I have a shattered spine that is essentially discintegrated. I need a lot of support while sleeping to get thru the night. I have never quite had what I would call pain free rest. Until this pillow......wow is an understatement. I can wrap this thing around and thru in a way it fully supports me. That moment of realization you feel no pressure...is when you fall asleep and get rested. I will buy again.'
b"Bought it at the end of my first trimester, and begrudgingly so. I was skeptical of spending this much money on a pillow. I WAS WRONG. This pillow is so fantastic that I have given her a name. I regret nothing. The length is great (I'm 5'9 so I'm tall) and the cover is SO SOFT. Love that is can be removed and washed really easily to, but I haven't actually washed it yet so I can't really say how it washes up. I love her and cannot imagine sleeping through my pregnancy without her."
b"I cant even explain how much I love this pillow. I bought 4 pregnancy pillows before I decided on this one. I am 3 months pregnant and even if I wasn't, I would still love this pillow. It has the perfect amount of firmness, and is just sooo comfortable! I feel like I am sleeping much better with this pillow. I bought another one to try but am not even going to bother with it, since I have been so comfortable with this one. I do with it was a little longer, but that is just because I am tall and its my preference, but honestly..it is fine how it is and works great. Love my new pillow!"
b"This is the best sleep I've had in a very long time! This pillow is a life saver. I ordered the extra long pillow with the removable cover. I got exactly that and it's exceeded my expectations. I'm not pregnant....long past that phase in my life. However, I do sleep on my side for the most part and usually have my head slightly elevated. I have gone from waking up multiple times in the night to readjust pillows that have slipped out of place to sleeping all the way through the night without having to make adjustments. The pillow is slightly firmer than what I was used to but it offers great support and keeps me from rolling onto my back and off the pillows. Love it!"
b"I am so glad I got this pillow for my first pregnancy!! It is so amazing!! you can lay on it multiple ways, and even use it as back support to breastfeed your baby or watch a movie on your bed. This pillow is the best thing ever and it is so soft and comfortable! It definitely helps me sleep better as well. I usually sleep on my stomach, but since i'm pregnant now, I can't do that and this pillow ensures that I do not end up on my stomach while sleeping. My chihuahua also loves cuddling up in the pillow and sleeping with me, lol! Whenever I get up to go pee, I always find her stealing my spot on the pillow! She loves it as much as I do! haha"
b'The best pregnancy pillow ever! This is the second pillow I got from Ang Qi. My husband after using my 55 inch one loved it so much I ordered him a longer one! I love the jersey cover because it is so easy to take off and put back on. My sister-in-law got a different pillow when she got pregnant and it was a pain to wash the cover because it was so difficult to take off and put back on. The jersey cover it came with is stretchy so it eliminates that problem completely. The cover is also very soft and keeps me cool during the hot summer nights! I absolutely love this pillow and would recommend it to anyone (not just pregnant women) who is in need of a body pillow!  (Even our dog loves the pillow!!)'
b"I'm 5'9'' and this pillow has changed my entire course of sleep, in a good way!! Like most, I wish I would've ordered this pillow when my pump started to show. I cannot sleep without this pillow! I have tried and it's hell! Lol! I am now 33 1/2 weeks pregnant and it's the only thing that helps me get through the night! When we travel to my mom's my boyfriend already knows that we are not to leave the house without that pillow or it will be a VERY long unpleasant weekend. Lol! I recommend this pillow to all pregnant and non pregnant women and folks alike!"
b'Do not look any further! This pillow is fantastic, the cover is so soft and its the perfect amount of support. I researched a ton of these and finally decided on this. I am 21 weeks pregnant but I have been having a hard time sleeping without hip pain for a few weeks. This was 100% solved by this pillow. I look forward to going home and curling up inside of it. Even my husband is jealous!'
b'Love love love it. Should have bought one of these 15 years ago'
b'So happy with my purchase! I\xe2\x80\x99m 6 months pregnant and have been using this body pillow for about a month and a half now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sleeping much better at night. This is my second pregnancy. I used the C shaped body pillow for my first pregnancy, and I think this pillow is much more comfortable. I ordered the gray velvet pillow cover and have no regrets! It\xe2\x80\x99s so soft, great pillow! It\xe2\x80\x99s also narrower than other similar pillows that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, which gives my husband more room on his side in our queen size bed.'
b'This pillow is a (preggo) lifesaver!! At 22 weeks pregnant, the aches and pains started setting in - waking me up and causing me to limp out of bed in the morning. I tried pillows on every angle...in front, back, between the legs, etc., without relief. After two weeks of misery, I ordered this pillow, and have slept soundly and painfree ever since!Length is also a bonus! I am 6\xe2\x80\x991\xe2\x80\x9d and while I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a surplus of length in this pillow, I am able to put the ends between my knees. The name brand pillow that I tried in store was not long enough for this. I do find that I still need 1 extra pillows for the legs to feel well enough supported.I am slightly worried about how long the stuffing will hold up, but for now I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping in a cloud.'
b'This pillow has taken away all of my nighttime hip pain! I am sleeping SO much better with this pillow. The snoogle was not fluffy enough to provide support and because its shaped like a "C", every time I turned, Id have to turn it with me, pain. This pillow being shaped like a U, just stays in place as I move around and it is much more full, so it seems to provide better support and also keep me from rolling totally flat on my back. Love.'
b'This pillow is so great! 2nd pregnancy and I have given up the stacked pillow fort of the old days. It is very cozy and comfortable- just wish it was longer because it does not go all the way to my feet. I\xe2\x80\x99m 5\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d and ordered the 60\xe2\x80\x9d pillow. Sleeping much more and more comfortably now that I have this support for back and belly. Wish the pillow case for this pillow wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so expensive, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I ended up getting it too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 23 weeks now and this pillow definitely helps a lot on keeping me sleep well at night. It\xe2\x80\x99s large and soft. The U sharp design replaced multiple pillows I had to have. I like it a lot.'
b'This is the most comfortable pillow ever! It\xe2\x80\x99s soft and cozy and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me too hot. I love that there is support in the front and back it makes it much easier to find a comfortable sleeping position, and turn from side to side at night. I was previously a back sleeper before I became pregnant and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get comfortable. This pillow has been a life saver. It takes up half of our queen size bed but my husband snuggles up to it as well'
b"Best pillow ever. I've never slept better"
b"I bought this pillow, not because I was pregnant, but because I have frozen shoulder.  No matter which way I turned, I would need to move the pillows surrounding me to support the shoulder.  Pillows were dropping all over the place and I had trouble sleeping for more than a couple of hours at a time.  I bought this pillow and have drastically reduced the number of pillows I need at night and can now regularly sleep through the night, It also replaces the pillow I had to support my knees while sleeping.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my sister, who is currently suffering from the same problem. We are both 5'11' and the larger size pillow option was wonderful since most of these types of pillows only support shorter people."
b'For my wife this was a lifesaver. She had a regular body pillow that while very comfortable pre pregnancy didn\xe2\x80\x99t cut the mustard during. She said the curve that goes around your neck was the difference. It aligned her body well.'
b'I dont know what I did without this pillow before pregnancy. I will use this after pregnancy too. My Hubby likes it too! Good quality and its great that you can wash the cover. Worth the price. Its great on the bed for sleeping and great on the couch to just be comfortable.'
b"This pillow is amazing. It supports my back and my belly. My hips and my back don't hurt as bad when I wake up in the morning.  I wish I would have bought this pillow sooner.  It's really nice. I'd definitely recommend it."

b"Very soft and relatively easy to put on. I'm glad I opted for this cover as the cover that comes on the Snoogle is very scratchy. I recommend trying to put the cover on like you would tights - bunch it up in your hand first and slowly slide up."
b"I LOVE this cover. I'm not ashamed to say I'm still using my snoogle even though my youngest baby just turned 4. I recently replaced my old cover with this one, and I've really been missing out. This is sooo soft! Not to mention it's so much easier to put on and and take off with the side zipper."
b"This case is so much easier to don than the original case. I do reccomend using the original case as well as this one to keep it's firmer shape. This case is exactly as I hoped!"

b"I got this for my massage practice because I work on pregnant women constantly. I was just having them lay on their side but it caused them shoulder pain after some time. I can't wait to use this! I laid on it myself and it was very comfortable. The face cradle is removable and I will be putting my own on it as this one is not the most comfortable. I will post a update after I use it.Update- 6/18/17I have used this a few times now on clients that are in their 3rd trimester and they absolutely love it! It is very supportive and comfortable.Update- 6/23/17I just used this on a client who is on their third trimester and she is petite. The chest area was uncomfortable for where there is a gap, I had to put a towel over it. The breast openings are very spread apart which made it awkward for my client who has a smaller frame.Update 7/11/17I used to face cushion that came with it and my client informed me that the next day their face felt bruised to the point that it hurt to smile. Don't use the face cradle, find one that is padded."
b'This was bought for a family member who experienced pregnancy-associated hand and foot swelling, as well as back and leg pain. Using this cushion during sleep really helped reduce her symptoms.'
b"Great for the expecting mama. I have even used this on my obese clients and they love it. I of course didn't tell them it was a pregnancy pillow. I would absolutely recommend this."
b'arrived the very next day (today).  Used it with the next client, an older gentleman who loved it.  Not only was it more comfortable than a flat massage table but also allowed his arms to be at his sides with greater comfort!'
b'As a massage therapist, I use this a lot. My pregnant clients love it and I use it for large breasted clients and some with large bellys that makes lying face down difficult. Worth the investment!'
b'My client who is 4 months pregnant felt totally relaxed and comfortable with this bolster.  Highly recommended and i had to just lower the table due to the added height of the cushion for me to work with no strain.'
b'My mommies love this and so do my bigger clients along with my clients that have had breast enhancement This cushion helps so many!'
b"I bought this for prenatal massage but I actually just used it on a client who had breast implants (they told me they're always uncomfortable laying face down on a massage table) and they loved it!"
b"Great investment! My prenatal clients prefer the pregnancy cushion over side-lying massage and are able to relax more deeply. It's a little awkward removing the cushion from the table so she can move into supine/semi-recline position, but no worse than repositioning her in sidelying with a million pillows. It's also useful for clients who can't quite get comfortable on a flat table due to a large stomach or chest. So glad I got it!"
b"Clients prefer this over side-lying.  The cushion is durable enough to keep it's shape and last for many years.  A very large man had to use this bolster after having surgery done on his stomach and it was so comfortable for him that he asked me where I got it so he can buy one.But I have a question!  Does anyone know if we're supposed to keep the client face down during the whole massage?  Or do we flip them over without removing the cushion under them and let them stay reclined?  Is it comfortable enough to lay on while supine?  I'm going to figure this out myself by lying on it, but if you guys have any tips let me know."
b'Perfect prenatal holster for my private practice \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b'I was quite excited to see the quality of this cushion. Was not expecting it to be quite so in perfect shape and even box was original.'
b'Wanted this cushion forever! Finally made that investment. Clients love it for late term pregnancy massage. I am LMT and own a massage clinic.'
b'Just what I needed to perform prenatal masssage.'
b'Use it for patients with bellies, large breast, and prenatal massage therapy. Works great!'
b'Worth the investment for our expecting clients!'
b'The wife is a massage therapist and needed this for her pregnant and larger busted clients.  It is great and she said she loves it.'
b'My clients LOVE this!!! Well worth the $$'
b'this is great for not only gravid women but anyone with a large gut'
b'Worth the money. Our pregnant  clients love these cushions! They get so excited to be able to lay on their stomachs again. We have 2 if these and they are great quality'

b"This pillow is definitely a must have! The shape is perfect. I have the larger hook of the pillow under my head since i am not pregnant yet and don't need the support on my belly. But I definitely need  a lot of support on my back. This is great for back support and just and over amazing pillow for great sleep. I noticed a lot of husbands don't like the idea of having this pillow but my husband loved it. I am happy, means he is happy. I have it so that i can still lay my head on his chest and still get great back support. So this pillow does not come between us :)The cover of the pillow is extremely soft, but because of the material which feels amazing to the skin it is very HOT. I personally had to buy a cotton cover to put over it. The only down side is that this brand doesn't have its own pillow covers that you can buy for this. The cover i got doesn't exactly fit it perfect but it is good enough."
b"I'm 20 weeks pregnant and have been using this for 2 weeks now. I'm normally a stomach sleeper and hate sleeping on my side as it makes my arms go numb. But this helps take the pressure off my arms and I have been sleeping significantly better than without this pillow. It's not too fluffy so I don't have a kinked neck when I wake up"
b"This is the most amazing pillow I've ever owned. I had hip surgery a few months ago, so good support is essential in my recovery. This pillow has been the answer to sleeping through the night. Even if you're not pregnant, I recommend this pillow 100%! I even bought my husband one because he used to sleep with a body pillow, and a pillow between his knees and every morning I would wake up and his pillows would be all over the bed. He grabbed my pillow to sleep every chance he could, so I bought him his own!"
b"This pillow is truly amazing! I am now 6 months pregnant and I am finally able to have a good night sleep without having pain and problem pressure points on my hips/sides. I have always slept on my back or stomach but since being pregnant I have to sleep on my sides. This pillow stands up to its claim and is made very well. I really only need this pillow to sleep plus we have a queen size bed and my husband has plenty of room to sleep with his 5 pillows. It doesn't take up much room at all and is really soft, comfortable and has the perfect amount of support I need. Thank you for this product!!"
b"I use it every night. It's so comfortable, it feels as if I'm being cradled. I wish it was fluffier/ thicker. I still have to use a pillow for my head bc other wise there would be no support for my neck. I do love this product tho."
b"Soft, supportive and just perfect. Also it's great that the microfiber cover unzips and comes off for washing. Already machine washed and dried it. Works great."
b'Wife used it throughout her pregnancy she loved it. I hated it was way too hot for me but who cares what a husband think it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the prego!! So 5 stars.'
b'Oh my God, this pillow is amazing. Am 17 weeks now and cant imagine sleeping without it. Very nice plush material, washable. Fantastic purchase.'
b"I've been looking for a perfect pillow that would help me sleep better and wake up the following morning not feeling tired. Ive tried many from standard pillows to expensive ones from different department stores at the mall. The thickness and softness of this amazing pillow is just right. I sleep like a baby with this one. I live in the middle of the pacific and my order came in a week!!! I bought 2, that's how happy I am with this pillow. BTW, I'm not pregnant. Who says you have to be to enjoy a good sleep?!"
b"This pillow is super comfy and makes me look forward to going to bed. It definitely improved my sleep as my pregnant belly got bigger. I use it sometimes in a propped-up position also if I want more support when I'm sitting up in bed or on the couch. The only (somewhat) downside is that I can't cuddle with my husband in bed the way I used to!"
b'These things work!'
b'Great pillow. I had shoulder surgery and could not have gotten sleep in the weeks after without it.'
b"My daughter is in her third trimester and was having a hard time sleeping. She decided to try this pregnancy pillow. She loves how she can roll from side to side easily. I have been having some back and hip issues and decided to try this pillow. There is support for my head, hips and knees. The velour cover feels so soft and the size is great it doesn't over take the bed like the pile of pillows I was using before."
b"This pillow is seriously the greatest! I used to use 3 different pillows to support my legs and my back but this pillow does it all! Its pretty firm which is nice between my legs. It really helps eliminate some of the aches and pains. The best part is the super soft cover that is so nice to snuggle with. If your pregnant you really should get one of these, you'll love it!"
b"This pillow provides great back and hip support because it wraps around your whole body and easily provides a resting place for your knees. It's also a pretty firm pillow so if you like resting your head on the really soft plush pillows then this may not be the pillow for you but I love it."
b"This pillow is very comfortable and has great support. It's nice to be able to just use this one pillow instead of having to use several to get the support I need. It has made my sleeping through pregnancy a lot easier."

b"I felt like I was taking a chance by purchasing this pillow and I kept going back and forth on if I should just get a few cheap body pillows and call it a day. HOWEVER, I'm expecting twins and I knew I would probably need something of better quality... I CANNOT begin to explain how thrilled I am that I decided to get this pillow. I have honestly slept so much better since having it. I know I will use this well beyond my pregnancy. I wish I would have used this pillow during my last pregnancy, I was stacking body pillows up all around me that would constantly fall over and shift, this pillow has been such a pleasure. THANK YOU!!!!"
b"I do love my Snoogle! It's comfy and easy to care for. The cover is easily removable to throw in the wash and doesn't warp to make it impossible to put back on. I love all the different ways to use this snuggle-fest and have utilized a lot of them already! It may be marketed for Pregger-ladies, but anybody that has trouble getting comfortable enough to sleep will surely love this product!"
b"I've been having trouble sleeping since around 20 weeks pregnant or so. I didn't think this pillow would help that much since I had a smaller version and a wedge, which weren't helping too much. But I caved and bought the Snoogle. Well worth it! I'm waking up less in the night and with much less achy shoulders/back. Luckily for my hubby we have a king size bed so he still has room to sleep in the bed :)"
b'Life saver for the pregnant woman with back ache. I love this pillow. it has truly made my pregnancy so much more comfortable. Sleeping has become better and i feel well rested in the morning. I love the removable cover. Its nice and narrow enough to not cover the whole bed. and its not too hard or too soft, just perfect.'
b'This is a game-changer. I\xe2\x80\x99ve used it for both pregnancies and still sleep with it and probably will forever. Excellent for side-sleepers, helps my back and hip pain tremendously, and this print is gorgeous! Thank you for existing, Snoogle!'

b'I\'ve had back pain for years, so I was really worried about how I would feel when pregnant. This pillow is amazing--my husband was jealous! It hugs around your back and provides great support for your belly. I slept really well and had minimal back pain during my entire pregnancy. I had to "wean" myself off this pillow afterwards because it wasn\'t the prettiest thing for our bedroom...but gosh is it comfortable!I would recommend ordering a second pillow case for it though, as it did get kinda gross during the 9+ months I used it (pilled around the legs).'
b'My wife claims this is the only thing that lets her sleep comfortably when pregnant. We recently went on a 10-day trip back home to see family and she loves it so much I had to fit this thing into a suitcase.'
b'I purchased this pillow during my pregnancy because I was having a hard time getting comfortable in bed. This really helped me find a sleeping position for my growing belly.'
b'Best pillow ever! I still use it and I had my baby a month ago! My husband wants it. Totally worth every penny and wish I would have bought it sooner!'
b'Fit perfect (after a bit of a struggle) on the pillow.'
b'My wife loved this pillow during pregnancy. it allowed her to get comfortable (finally lol) and actually sleep a whole night.'
b"We love it matches our BACK belly pillow for my wife she' loves it little tricky to put on but oh well it's long pillow"
b"I would not want to go through another pregnancy without this pillow. It made my nights 90% better.. A must buy for uncomfortable pregnant mommy's to be."
b'Great!'
b'I ordered 2 of these pillows and my husband and I both just love them.  We can sleep on our back or either side comfortably now.'
b"It's big and bulky but an absolute must have. You can toss and turn without taking your pillow with you. I could not live without it."
b'I used this pillow throughout my pregnancy (I was carrying twins) and it was a complete lifesaver.  It totally cradles your body and gives you support where you need it most (back, neck). I took the pillow to the hospital with me when I had my twins. Everyone in the hospital wanted to get one of their own.  I still use it because it is that comfortable. Oh yeah, if you have a small bed, you may not want to purchase this.  We have a king and there is still plenty of space.'
b'This pillow is a wonderful gift for any pregnant mom.  But, the cover can get old and needs to be replaced!'
b'My daughter loves the pillow'
b'Loving having an extra cover.'
b'Super comfy'
b'Great product. Half of the price than in Australia. Very happy.'
b"It's a little big, but it's ridiculously comfortable. It comes super quick,  I got mine 2 days later. I would say it's 100% worth a try."
b"This thing is a Godsend! I loved that it was all one giant pillow and not a bunch of them Velcro'd together like one I previously bought and returned. I really would never have been able to sleep ever while I was pregnant if I didn't have this. It also was very awesome after my daughter was born since I had to have an emergency c-section and it was painful to lay down in bed. Highly recommend this!"
b'It came on time and works great for my body pillow.'
